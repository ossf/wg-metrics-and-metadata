# About

The purpose of this document is to build a mutual understanding of the high-level threats,
security risks, and potential mitigations associated with the open source ecosystem. There
is a natural overlap between these threats and risks, and those that affect the more general
software development process.

The primary intended audience consists of members of the
[Open Source Security Foundation](https://github.com/ossf) and similar organizations
interested in promoting and advancing improvements to the security of the open source ecosystem,
but should not be considered as a product roadmap or promised set of features. It should also
be noted that this document focuses exclusively on security risk and does not include risks
related to intellectual property (i.e. patents, copyright, licensing, contracts) or other
domains.
