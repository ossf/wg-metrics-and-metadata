# Identifying Security Threats in Open Source Projects

The purpose of this working group is to enable stakeholders to have informed
confidence in the security of open source projects. We do this by collecting,
curating, and communicating relevant metrics and metadata from open source
projects and the ecosystems of which they are a part.

### Motivation

Open source software is an essential part of modern software development, and
of practically all technology solutions. Adoption of open source software has
grown over the past two decades, powering everything from tiny "Internet of
Things" devices to the most advanced supercomputers in the world. This has led
to enormous productivity gains, allowing software engineers to focus more on
solving business problems and less on creating and re-creating the same
building blocks needed in many situations.

With these benefits, however, comes some risk. Attackers frequently target
open source projects and the ecosystems they are a part of in order to 
compromise the organizations or users that use those projects. It's
essential that we understand these threats and work to build defenses against
them.

### Objective

Our objective is to enable stakeholders to have informed confidence in the
security of open source projects. This includes identifying threats to the
open source ecosystem and recommending practical mitigations. We will also
identify a set of key metrics and build tooling to communicate those metrics
to stakeholders, enabling a better understanding of the security posture of
individual open source software components.

### Scope

The scope of this working group includes "security", as opposed to privacy,
resiliency, or other related areas. We also consider the broad open source
ecosystem, as opposed to focusing exclusively on critical open source projects.


### Active Projects

* [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec) - Provides a mechanism for projects to report information about their security practices in a machine-readable way.
  * Lead: Luigi Gubello

* **Security Risk Dashboard** - This project's purpose is to collect, organize, and provide interesting security metrics for
  open source projects to stakeholders, including users.
  * Lead: Jay White

* [Security Reviews](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews) -
  This repository contains a collection of security reviews of open source software.
