<h5>**[Identifying Security Threats in Open Source Projects WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats) **</h5>


**The Identifying Security Threats in Open Source Projects WG collects, curates, and communicates relevant metrics and metadata from open source projects and the ecosystem. This is important because it enables stakeholders to have informed confidence in the security of open source projects. **


**Roadmap goal: **

* **Build and deploy the Risk Dashboard to replace the OpenSSF [Metric Dashboard](https://metrics.openssf.org).**
* **Update the [Threats, Risks, and Mitigations in the Open Source Ecosystem](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/publications/threats-risks-mitigations/v1.1/Threats%2C%20Risks%2C%20and%20Mitigations%20in%20the%20Open%20Source%20Ecosystem%20-%20v1.1.pdf) white paper with new threats, mitigations, and progress made since first published.**
* **Drive awareness and use cases for [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec)_._**
* **Expand [Security Reviews](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews) and make it more easily consumable.**
* Project Updates
* Security Insights
* Biggest gap: Specification document needs to be completed by Monday 10/2. Luigi to send draft by 9/29.

* We need to push for adoption within OpenSSF *next week*.

Issue Text ‚Äì only apply to code projects, not WG, TAC, etc.

**ISSUE TITLE**: Please adopt OpenSSF Security Insights for this project

Hello from the OpenSSF Security Insights team!


Security Insights is a specification for expressing security-relevant metadata about a project in a machine-readable format. It allows you to express things like where a project is in its lifecycle, what kind of security tools are used, and whether you want to accept automated pull requests. It complements Scorecard metrics by focusing on things that often can‚Äôt be found by analyzing repository contents.

As part of our launch, we‚Äôd like to see OpenSSF adopt the Security Insights specification across our code projects. This is as simple as adding a SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml file to your repository root. We‚Äôve created a <Getting Started> guide, and tThe entire process should take less than 10 minutes. The full specification is located <here>.

If you have questions about the Security Insights specification or this request, feel free to reach out to us on slack (#security_insights_spec) or open an issue in our repository (ossf/security-insights-spec).

**Slack Text**

* Working on a section to recommend open-source tools (Sigstore, Scorecard, etc)
* SECURITY INSIGHTS (Luigi)
* CNCF is evaluating SECURITY INSIGHTS because it can help for compliance (e.g. ISO, etc) and find resources (Eddie K.)
* Use SECURITY INSIGHTS as data source (e.g. to fill out Security Badge)
* OpenSSF Best Practices badge also has some data
* BP badge already does some automation
* BP badge already DOES have fields for URLs, and in some cases users MUST provide URLs to get credit for criteria. So you could look at badge to get some URLs
* BP badge is considering use (reading from) SECURITY-INSIGHTS for automation when it exists. However, Scorecard has more data (>1million projects) & probably more relevant fields, so David A. Wheeler plans to prioritize reading from Scorecard FIRST and then consider loading from SECURITY-INSIGHTS after that works
* If we‚Äôre going to spread its use, we should say something!
* Eddie: I made some GitHub issues - are any unclear? [https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/issues/26](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/issues/26) Eddie: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big proponent of optional‚Äù
* Other topics:
* Eddie Knight is organizing the ‚Äúsecurity slam‚Äù for CNCF; they‚Äôre doing it once, he hopes to have it annually
* He thinks SECURITY-INSIGHTS could eliminate one of their pain points, ‚Äúwhere is your SBOM, where are your docs, etc.?‚Äù We didn‚Äôt have a plan before.

* Best: compare to other projects, then we can get an idea
* E.g.: ‚Äú# of contributors‚Äù. 1 isn‚Äôt ideal, but it‚Äôs common, letting people KNOW that the situation is common is helpful.
* Make it clear that some metrics are NOT easily actionable by developers, e.g., 2FA of repo, # of co-developers. They‚Äôre still risks from the POV of the potential user, but it‚Äôs not the developer‚Äôs fault. Include this in the ‚ÄúCaveats‚Äù page of the dashboard (need to make one)?
* Security Reviews
* The build process problem - it‚Äôs not getting the hyphen, still not sure what‚Äôs going on. (#87)
* PR #88 should fix it
* Amir will keep cleaning the repo

* Security Reviews (Amir)
* David A. Wheeler: I have a grad student doing a brief review of BitWarden, I have asked him to add his review to this when it‚Äôs ready. I encourage others in universities to ask their students to notify us of any reviews they do.
* Amir: I‚Äôm cleaning up the repo, fixing reviews with blanks where there shouldn‚Äôt be blanks
* Metric Dashboard (Jay)
* Great progress on risk dashboard. Michael Hart & Sarah Evans has joined our band.
* Rahul continues to work on creating the code, look & feel
* Michael Hart is working on PM - trying to get info on ‚Äúwhat is needed‚Äù, etc.
* Got some good contacts in Bitergia & MITRE - want to expand beyond GitHub for GitHub data, so we can understand better what they do, maybe we can use/build on their efforts to get more data.
* We plan to develop something to show by OpenSSF Day. Not a full demo, but at least mock-ups & maybe some running code.
* By the end of May we should be able to bring a workable demo to this WG.
* In general, don‚Äôt let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
* We can‚Äôt please everyone all the time. Instead, we‚Äôre developing it incrementally (‚Äúevolutionary prototype‚Äù) - we are continuously improving it.
* How do we deal with single maintainers? MANY OSS projects are OSS, so can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúall bad‚Äù
* Eventually will rename existing metrics.openssf.org to legacy.metrics.openssf.org and will deploy new one at metrics.openssf.org.

Agenda:



* Welcome new members - Matia, Interested to find out about the activities in this group.
* Project Updates - Virtual Mini-Summit for Maintainers of Critical OSS Projects - Ixchell gave the update. ‚ÄúHappened last week (Feb 22), successfully done. Took notes from people attending. Next steps: Generate a report, present to TAC members. People were happy to be a part of it. People said that they want the event to be larger and with more frequency.‚Äù Alex added: ‚ÄúThere were over 20 participants from different foundations. The event was not recorded. The next step is to summarize it and publish a blog as well. Send a message to the community.‚Äù
* Project Updates - Metrics Dashboard - Jay gave the update: ‚ÄúGreat meeting on Friday. CRoB presented a new look for the dashboard. Discussion around how to present it better. Exploring potential to request funding to support the work.‚Äú
* Project Updates - Security Reviews. Amir was not present.
* Project Updates - Security Insights. Luigi was not present.
* Proposed Future Work - Survey open source maintainers on vulnerability management. Munawar and Yesenia are planning this. A survey was done earlier during the Virtual Mini-Summit for Maintainers of Critical OSS Projects. Here is the link to the questions asked there:  [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=C_2B0GOtUIwwHGyWNyMcHvwvhRjZ3DoiRq65nSj_2FOC_2FFXEQfKjf4saBt4zSNNvKVw5](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=C_2B0GOtUIwwHGyWNyMcHvwvhRjZ3DoiRq65nSj_2FOC_2FFXEQfKjf4saBt4zSNNvKVw5)     The survey was covering many different topics, but this current version that is being planned will be focusing on vulnerability management. Munawar proposed the idea and asked for suggestions of what questions can be asked, how this can be administered, etc. David suggested coordinating with LF research on this. Yesenia will be covering the survey administration part; since she is part of LF, she will follow up with the LF research team.

* Ixchel Ruiz (JFrog)
* Yesenia Yser (Alpha-Omega)
* Amir Montazery (OSTIF)

Agenda:



* Welcome new members
* Project Updates
* Virtual Maintainer Summit
* Personally connecting with the folks invited to get confirmation
* 14-15 maintainers committed to it + some folks from OpenSSF
* Two breakout sessions (CRob and Bob)
* Date: February 22‚ãÖ10:30am ‚Äì 12:00pm EST
* David Wheeler: I have a conflict on the first part at that time, but I can show up later to help. Don‚Äôt wait for me, I‚Äôm always happy when people go get things done!!
* Metrics Dashboard
* Going well. Nirav is working on an updated mockup display, to be shared.
* The goal is to have a working demo to bring to the WG. Hoping to do that in a few meetings from now, but don‚Äôt have a timetable.
* Have there been funding discussions? The financial climate at the moment suggests it‚Äôd be prudent to know if this is coming from the OpenSSF general budget, need to talk with Brian etc., to ensure there‚Äôs money available. Need to scale this to the money actually available.
* Other topics:
* Security Reviews (Amir)
* David: I re-emphasized to Nirav that we want links to security-reviews from the metrics dashboard, where they are available. It worked well on the dashboard prototype.
* The new index looks great!!
* Action Item: Upload individual reviews to repo
* What about OpenSSF scorecards? Maybe add that link too?
* What about making it easy to *automatically* find something given a URL? David: I‚Äôd be happy to add that to the best practices badge, but I need it to be easy.
* Security-reviews has pkg: data, but matching on that when you have source code repo URLs is tricky.
* A simpler approach would be a simple text search on the project name. Example: [https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aossf%2Fsecurity-reviews+openssl+path%3Areviews&type=code](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aossf%2Fsecurity-reviews+openssl+path%3Areviews&type=code)
* It‚Äôs not *pretty*, but it works. This proposal has been added as an issue to [https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1916](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1916) . It‚Äôs a plausible minimum viable product (MVP).
* Don't forget to bring up:
* security reviews <=> assurance assertions
* [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/reviews/_omega_/npm/ansi-yellow/omega-review-0.1.1-2022-05-05.md](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/reviews/_omega_/npm/ansi-yellow/omega-review-0.1.1-2022-05-05.md)

* Other topics:
* [https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/issues/18](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/issues/18)
* Can tech lay-offs also impact open-source security?
* Project Updates
* Virtual Maintainer Summit
* Mails went out, very few responses. Will be reaching out more personally to each one.
* SECURITY INSIGHTS - Provides a mechanism for projects to report information about their security practices in a machine-readable way. Lead: Luigi Gubello
* Maybe it‚Äôs reasonable to say, ‚Äúevery project must have a SECURITY.md file‚Äù
* Maybe allow it in a ‚Äúdoc/‚Äù or ‚Äúdocs/‚Äù subdirectory, maybe also those.
* Totally agree!
* Must be automatically findable!
* https://github.com/withastro/.github <-- org-level policy files
* Help Needed:
* Help get OpenSSF to adopt SECURITY.md across all repos (including the default template), and/or .github meta-repo.
* SBOM -> where should these go?
  * More clarity coming in the next few weeks on the different types of SBOMs and should lead to where they should be stored (at least in some cases).
* Security Metrics - This project's purpose is to collect, organize, and provide interesting security metrics for open source projects to stakeholders, including users. Lead: Michael Scovetta [existing implementation] Leads: Vinod, Jay White, Christine Abernathy
* Risk Dashboard - in discussion, please join that group if interested. Have a mock-up that‚Äôs been commented on & being changed by Nirav. Last meeting Nirav had a conflict. The plan is to improve the mockup, review, agree, and then start implementing for a demo.
* Next meeting will be Feb 10, noon US Eastern Time.
* Office Hours experiment for OpenSSF
* No one signed up last time ‚òπÔ∏è. Should we try again?
* David: Why didn‚Äôt anyone sign up? My current guess is people were afraid to air dirty laundry.
* Mike: Maybe we didn‚Äôt advertise it enough. Also, it‚Äôd be someone on an OSS project who had a problem right then. Maybe if it was every week at a specific time it‚Äôd be easier. I think it‚Äôd be easier if was available more times.
* Randall: Many aren‚Äôt clear what OpenSSF is, never mind show up for office hours. Old time projects (e.g., GNOME, kernel, etc.), think we‚Äôre just a lot of cruft. Need to follow up with them somehow.
* Security Reviews - This repository contains a collection of security reviews of open source software.
* Hot off press: ‚ÄúIndependent Security Audit Impact Report‚Äù [https://openssf.org/blog/2023/02/01/independent-security-audit-impact-report/](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/02/01/independent-security-audit-impact-report/)
* Notes the security audits of git, sigstore, curl, jackson-core / jackson-databind, slf4j, & envoy.
* We need to make sure those are listed - ask Amir if they‚Äôre in? E.g., curl, git
* The git evaluation found & fixed vulnerabilities, but it‚Äôs a lot of C and follow-on work would be wise.
* Need to ensure that new dashboard links to this.
* Could Best Practices badge link to this automatically somehow? [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews) How can we index things better? At least provide an index as a file?
* Update the home page generation script to emit a .json file with (github url and/or home URL -> review url) maps for David to consume into best practices.
* Question: How do we handle where there are multiple reviews? Could there be a ‚Äúlist‚Äù page that links to all the reviews for a match? That way, if there‚Äôs >1 review, the best practices badge could link to one site that links to the other pages.
* David: if you can provide that info for me, I‚Äôll be happy to tweak the best practices badge website to link to the security reviews!
* The Scorecards project could also consume this information & include it as relevant information (& eventually even score projects on whether or not they‚Äôve had 3rd party reviews).
* Perhaps spin off a separate group for v1.2 or whatever, give us something to announce for ‚ÄúSecurity Threats‚Ä¶‚Äù document. Probably use markdown. You can insert HTML in the markdown to make it pretty.
* Luigi - can use Slack channel to discuss.

Identifying Security Threats

Purpose:
To enable stakeholders to have informed confidence in the security of open source projects. We do this by collecting, curating, and communicating relevant metrics and metadata from open source projects and the ecosystems of which they are a part.

Everyone is welcome to participate in our working group and help build the future. Find us on the OpenSSF public calendar.

Number of Regular Contributors:
10-15

2022 Highlights
Metrics Dashboard provides information on open source software (OSS) packages/projects to help users and potential users to evaluate their risks. We have developed a prototype, and are in the early stages of building a full dashboard based on that experience. We expect it will build on the OpenSSF Scorecards, OpenSSF Best Practices badge, contribution data, and vulnerability data (among other data sources).
Security Reviews collects and curates security reviews performed against OSS, to enable easily finding this information. We published 104 new reviews in 2022.
Office Hours provides a forum for maintainers to talk to security experts about any (security-related) topic. The first session didn't have any non-expert registrants, which suggests to us the need for more lead time and publicity targeted at potential requestors.
Security Insights provides a way for OSS maintainers to express information regarding security posture and practices in place in the project in both human-readable and machine-readable format (YAML). 

Impact
Growing participation and discussion of what metrics are important for human understanding of risks in OSS projects/packages.

What's Next
A Virtual Maintainer Summit is being planned for January 2023.
The Metrics Dashboard SIG is working on scenarios and mockups.
We'll be scheduling additional Office Hours in early 2023, along with more lead time and publicity targeted at potential registrants.
We regularly discuss potential new projects; come join in the conversation!

Agenda:



* Metrics Dashboard SIG Proposal (Azeem, Nirav, Jay)
* Suggestion: Create a ‚ÄúMission, Vision, Strategy, Roadmap‚Äù for this project.
* Example (for Alpha-Omega): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_vMQkGybBBCMmRdEwVd96S_1n0PiJ6aJ50utnSbmcw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_vMQkGybBBCMmRdEwVd96S_1n0PiJ6aJ50utnSbmcw/edit?usp=sharing)
* We had consensus to form the SIG, no objections.
* Video Walkthrough of a Security Review Proposal (chat)
* This obviously needs a catchier name.
* (David) Red Hat does this for threat modeling reviews - rewarding experience, raises awareness for engineering teams. Particularly helpful for engineers to better understand their own projects.
* (Luigi) Topic is pretty large, we should have a defined scope here.
* (Munawar) Consider an episode arc:
* Threat modeling
* Running tools
* Setting up fuzzing
* Triaging results
* Etc.
* Next Step: Connect with Amir for suggestions on how to proceed, we‚Äôll about again in two weeks if nothing happens sooner.
* (David) Let‚Äôs do this for the Metrics Dashboard project
* Project Updates
* Security Insights
* PR open ([https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/pull/17](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/pull/17)) to address maintainers that don‚Äôt want to accept pull requests from bots.
* Issue open for Scorecard ([https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/2305](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/2305))

<h2>2022-09-14 Meeting</h2>


Attendance (please add yourself):



* David A. Wheeler (Linux Foundation)
* Matt Rutkowski (IBM)
* Emily Fox (Apple, CNCF TOC)
* Munawar Hafiz (OpenRefactory)
* Luigi Gubello
* Jay White (Microsoft)
* Rodrigo Pulido
* Alex Kim (IBM)

Regrets:



* Michael Scovetta (can‚Äôt attend)

Agenda:



* David A. Wheeler: Setting up discussions with LFX, etc., regarding next steps for metrics dashboard. Step 1: Identifying requirements
* Basically, create a new meeting (Doodle poll)
* Meeting would be to ID requirements & next steps to implement a better metrics dashboard (beyond metrics.openssf.org, LFX Security)
* Metrics.openssf.org is a simple Grafana
* Don‚Äôt want to just duplicate scorecards.
* Want something that is human-friendly.
* Maybe more than security. (say sustainability)
* Luigi: I thought the previous dashboard was a good idea, perhaps hard to get the information.
* David: I can set up Doodle poll
* David: I think one issue is a desire for info that‚Äôs harder to get: static tool analysis, whether or not you can rebuild the package, etc.
* Luigi: Security Insights Update
* One project didn‚Äôt really appreciate the automatic information; link to the Slack thread: https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C019M98JSHK/p1662965685024309
* Munawar: Our tool identifies issues with nearly no false positives. Our website launched earlier. Found only important bugs, e.g., Ansible you‚Äôd get 3000-4000 bug reports from others (can‚Äôt work with that), we only identified ~20 but they were high value. We selected a small set of maintainers, manually submitted pull requests (but they were structured). DIdn‚Äôt find messaging differences helped. I don‚Äôt think submitting automated pull requests helps. First step is to improve the quality of the scans. If the results are good, which was true in the case of the scans in the project, people will accept them. We found that with very minimal effort, 10 of the 24 bugs (~40%) we submitted got accepted in a week. 6 were declined but even in those cases, the issue was that the attack surface was not clear,  specific part of the code was not maintained, etc. So, not strong rejections.
* Scan results at: [https://pypi.openrefactory.com/](https://pypi.openrefactory.com/)
* Blog post: [https://www.openrefactory.com/how-to-serve-open-source-software-maintainers-without-annoying-them/](https://www.openrefactory.com/how-to-serve-open-source-software-maintainers-without-annoying-them/)
* David: Jon L. is having success with automatically creating PRs, but his approach is very different. He finds a very specific code pattern that‚Äôs wrong, & then looks for that extremely specific pattern.
* Fair.  It depends on the patch itself - some have 30-40% acceptance, more recent PRt was only 1% accepted because it was more aggressive.
* Luigi: It‚Äôs common that there‚Äôs a security wrapper for a project. Alpha-Omega has worked this. Need contact, etc.
* In a system with a package manager, repo, maybe we can find something that scales better.
* Munawar Hafiz: Who is sending the PRs? If OpenSSF is sending the PRs, there‚Äôs a better reception instead of ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming from some company‚Äù
* Michael Scovetta / Munawar Hafiz: Virtual summit for maintainers of critical OSS projects planning task force - proposed by Michael Scovetta
* Had two meetings (9/6, 9/13)
* Draft ideas/meeting minutes : [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_T1nEyzbVufoAhRwOtYcE6nc4cAsqlwP_oVbhxufM2Q/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_T1nEyzbVufoAhRwOtYcE6nc4cAsqlwP_oVbhxufM2Q/edit#)
* Plan is to create a steering committee. ID scope. Who will be involved? How many?
* Second issue: What‚Äôs the format? 4 hours? Panel(s)? Funding?
* This is in VERY early stages.
* Alex Kim: Need to determine if it‚Äôs OpenSSF. If it‚Äôs a recurring event, can have positive impact on the community.
* Emily: Running events such as this is a lot of work, but valuable. Its important to know who the audience is and what you want them to get out of it? There are a lot of focus areas, particularly for maintainers and you‚Äôll need to ensure they understand the value and return they get for participating.  You can execute it as an unconference / workshop as part of a larger conference can be effective, but you want some larger structures and topics for attendees to gravitate towards. Work towards those goals.
* Will you do a CFP? Is it more of a summit or forum for information exchange. Do you need tracks or will folks all be in the same track.
* If you stripped down the top critical projects to just the top 100, they have ~5 each, that‚Äôs already 500 people!! Which makes an unconference much more difficult
* Knowing how many potential attendees will narrow selection of the platform
* There are MANY options. Maybe webinar, open forum. Twitter spaces (confusing!)
* Select platform once you know what you want to accomplish
* You might want to be co-located event with another conference to off load some of the awareness and marketing.
* As co-chair for KubeCon, I‚Äôve worked with LF Events on a lot of events , sub-events,etc (im not the only one!). LF Events will depend on you to make decisions on format / speakers / etc. anything you provide in advance makes that easier for them
* Alex Kim: Great insight. It‚Äôd be great if you could join our discussion! We‚Äôre thinking about making it virtual to avoid travel.
* Emily: Virtual can be good. Make sure they can speak.
* Also: Selection criteria - which projects, realistically?
* David: THANK YOU to Emily & all people willing to put in the effort to make these things happen!!
* Anyone else?

* Metrics Dashboard
* No particular updates or progress in the last weeks (holidays / Open Source Security Summer)
  
* Office Hours - we believe the goal is for any OSS developers to show up on Slack and ask security-related questions, someone will try to answer.
* Owner: Marta Rybczynska
* See the [Slack message](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01A50B978T/p1657125892864519).
* We have a Slack channel: [#office_hours](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03LTHA6M61)
* Marta‚Äôs not here to discuss, so let‚Äôs discuss it later.
* Alpha-Omega (Michael Scovetta not here today, skipping)
* Security Reviews
* New review added: [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/reviews/cri-o/crio.md](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/reviews/cri-o/crio.md)
* Will continue to add new OSTIF audits and security reviews as they become public
* There‚Äôs a newer system called ‚Äúcargo vet‚Äù - it records ‚ÄúI looked at this package‚Äù (briefly) for others. Might have a connection long term.
* Link: [https://mozilla.github.io/cargo-vet/](https://mozilla.github.io/cargo-vet/)
* What do we do about people asking OSS projects to fill in questionnaires? [https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1542589998725300229](https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1542589998725300229)
* OpenSSF (CII) Best Practices Badge can be good to answer similar questions - that is specifically designed for OSS (as opposed to this)
* David A. Wheeler: I don‚Äôt see a problem in asking for a project to fill in a form - if you get such a request, reply with ‚Äúsure, here‚Äôs my fee if you want to fill that out‚Äù. The main problem is if the requestor expects this form to be filled in for free. But that‚Äôs easily educated out: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to do something you‚Äôre not paying me to do‚Äù. Instead, OSS projects can charge a fee - they‚Äôre providing a service (filling in a form) that can‚Äôt be as easily provided elsewhere (anyone could fill in the form, but it wouldn‚Äôt be from that specific project).
* Perhaps need to connect more with TODO group, get OSPOs created & more involved.
* David: Is this ISO 27001?
* Not certain, but looks like it.
* ISO terminology ‚Äúpublicly available‚Äù - many ISO standards are not publicly available.
* We could try to help OSS projects answer questionnaires (which we thinks are 27001-style questions). However, people often don‚Äôt ask the same questions, and it‚Äôs so disconnected from OSS that it may not be worthwhile.
* Look at this example of questionnaire: [https://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/iso-iec-27001/resources/BSI-ISOIEC27001-Assessment-Checklist-UK-EN.pdf](https://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/iso-iec-27001/resources/BSI-ISOIEC27001-Assessment-Checklist-UK-EN.pdf) - imagine trying to answer this for an OSS project, remembering that OSS projects typically don‚Äôt employ contributors, aren‚Äôt a single organization, etc. (hint: it won‚Äôt work):
* Is there a mobile device policy and teleworking policy in place?
* Are human resources subject to screening, and do they have terms and conditions of employment defining their information security responsibilities?
* Are employees required to adhere to the information security policies and procedures, provided with awareness, education and training, and is there a disciplinary process?
* We could identify answers to these into SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml
* David A. Wheeler: but probably not for most of them (not clear it‚Äôd add value)
* We could add some, maybe.
* Luigi could look over the checklists to see what might be added
* David: Feel free, might help a little, but probably won‚Äôt help the checklist people enough.

* Summit Follow Up
* [https://openssf.org](https://openssf.org)
* Mobilization Plan: [https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/](https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/)
* Broad consensus that the mobilization plan was a reasonable direction, most not controversial
* Now we have to ‚Äúgo do it‚Äù. Bottoms up approach currently: Each WG looks at plan, decide which parts they want to pursue.
* David: there were various refinements, but that‚Äôs what they were, refinements. E.G., text on stream 1 (education) discussed college, in breakouts there was a discussion about K-12 as well. Similarly, outside that discussion there was a comment that reproducible builds wasn‚Äôt specifically mentioned in the plan - that‚Äôs true, but stream 10 discusses SLSA & SLSA includes reproducible builds. I think the idea is simply to agree that we‚Äôre working in these general directions & we‚Äôll refine as we implement.
* Office Hours
* Proposal: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwz-24onzf9IMB4WeCnV9iq2wA7W47Remx0KEpLzxLI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwz-24onzf9IMB4WeCnV9iq2wA7W47Remx0KEpLzxLI/edit?usp=sharing)
* Note, this relates to stream 5 & stream 6
* Low risk, why not try it out?
* Potential issues: No one shows up? Naming is hard ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù?
* How do we make sure the right experts show? E.g., if looking at code, need someone who knows that language.

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Continue discussion on challenges to updating dependencies with known vulnerabilities (log4j)
* Often it‚Äôs more expensive to be SURE you don‚Äôt need to upgrade than upgrade.
* One claim, 42% log4j is 1.X (source uncertain)
* [https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/three-months-later-41-of-log4j-downloads-are-of-vulnerable-versions](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/three-months-later-41-of-log4j-downloads-are-of-vulnerable-versions)
* [https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/l0g4j-attack-surface-remains-huge](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/l0g4j-attack-surface-remains-huge)
* [https://www.rezilion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Log4Shell-4-Months-Later.pdf](https://www.rezilion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Log4Shell-4-Months-Later.pdf) (Rezilion)
* David: Harvard ‚ÄúCensus II‚Äù found many log4j users use 1.X, not sure if it was 42% but it‚Äôs clearly a big problem
* [https://linuxfoundation.org/tools/census-ii-of-free-and-open-source-software-application-libraries/](https://linuxfoundation.org/tools/census-ii-of-free-and-open-source-software-application-libraries/)
* Jonathan L: Gradle doesn‚Äôt make automatic upgrading easy. Gradle as a build tool you declare your dependencies, those files are executable source code (code, map, etc.)
* Gradle used to build most Java & nearly all Android.
* If you have a multi-project build, you may not even get all the dependencies on a particular run.
* One of the last things I built in Gradle would automatically be applied inside the Grable build to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to what was resolved during that build, could send to GitHub (like SARIF for CodeQL), so tools like Snyk & Dependabot could get that information.
* Someone else will need to (if desired): A Gradle build is an executable bit of code, I was working on a proposal. Gradle solves a set of constraints. Let‚Äôs claim that vulnerability info is another constraint (‚Äúdependencies that should not be used‚Äù) so you use the ‚Äúnext safe version‚Äù. I‚Äôd love to solve that problem at some point.
* Gradle doesn‚Äôt have lock files. If you modify lockfile, & then regen the lockfile, it‚Äôs useless.
* Can we create an ‚Äúoverride‚Äù in package managers while still supporting determinism, running tests before shipping, etc?
* In particular, can we create a proposal to send e.g., to the repo WG?
* `pip install -no-vulnerable -r requirements.txt`?
* `pip install ‚Äìauto-update-vulnerable -r requirements.txt`
* Maybe just get each package manager to explicitly warn?
* `npm audit` for all package ecosystems?
* David: Issue: When I build I want to auto-update when building for test, but in production I only want to run what was tested.
* David W & Jon L agreed that stopping a build on known-vulnerable components can work on small projects, but you wouldn‚Äôt want to do that on a 1000-person project.
* Michael S: Organ donors opt-in vs opt-out shows that the default matters.
* ‚ÄúSecuring Software repos‚Äù seems like the right group to bring this to.
* **Who would like to run with with this?** 
* **David Sastre**, Jonathan Leitschuh, David A. Wheeler
* How can users avoid using vulnerable components easily?pip
* Alternate registry endpoint -> goodonly.registry.npmjs.com, etc.?
* OWASP SCVS & pac-man is somewhat related.

* Add to [https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter)?
* Project Updates
* Security Insights (CNCF) - Luigi
* Presented to CNCF a few weeks ago
* Good feedback, no strong opinions against it fundamentally.
* Can proceed.
* Alpha: Advocate for Security-Insights to be added to Alpha-engaged projects.
* Let‚Äôs get this added to OpenSSF projects.
* Engage w/ Mark Cox re: Apache projects?
* [https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec](https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec)
* It would be nice to have a wizard to create YAML files.

* Coordinate w/ vulnerability WG
* Get OpenSSF projects to adopt this
* **Volunteer needed to help Luigi on this:**
  * David Sastre
* Security Reviews
* Metrics Dashboard - Christine
* Replacement/future of metrics.openssf.org
* Comparing existing dashboards (deps.dev, metrics.openssf, etc.)
* Open questions around who is using metrics dashboard right now.
* _Consider _whether looking at Security Insights (yaml) makes sense.
* Other Topics
* Yehuda - detecting attackers across multiple language platforms
* Ping Oliver Chang or Caleb Brown
* OpenSSF already has a tool in development to look for malicious packages, ‚Äúpackage-analysis‚Äù (part of the critical projects WG):
* [https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis](https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis)
* David: Just like virus checkers, no such tool can *guarantee* to find all malicious packages, but detecting *some* & countering them is great.
* David: I expect a blog post will be coming up soon about package-analysis, stay tuned!!

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
* Continue discussion on challenges to updating dependencies (log4j / 42% issue)
* Basically, many people continue to use a vulnerable version of log4j even though it‚Äôs well-known
* Main problem: developers aren‚Äôt updating
* DavidW: Possible reason?: there is no pressure to update.
* DavidW: Possible solution?: SBOM to end users, so they put pressure back on developers to update.
* Potential issues with this approach:
* Maybe no users will look at SBOM.
* Maybe the ‚Äúplease update your thing‚Äù pressure won‚Äôt be actioned.
* DavidW: Second part: Making it easier for developers to know they have vulnerable components (dependabot etc.)
* VM: Hard part is getting developers to do it, so it needs to be easy for developers to create SBOMs. Need to get info out on ‚Äúhow to generate SBOMs easily‚Äù
* Mike S: SBOMs only solve a part of the problem. The bar is relatively low for an organization to know what‚Äôs in there.
* What about back-end services?
* DavidW: US government *has* mooted this. E.g., ‚Äúwhereas embedded systems or online services can have pointers to SBOM data stored online.‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Minimum Elements For a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)‚Äù. I don‚Äôt speak for the US government, but I think they very much intend to do this, but are focusing on software deployed in-house first.
* Cyclonedx supports services: [https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/#software-as-a-service-bom-saasbom](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/#software-as-a-service-bom-saasbom)
* Example of a service which does this: [https://jupiterone.com/sbom/](https://jupiterone.com/sbom/)
* How can you force updates deep in the chain?
* DavidW: Should we enable overrides of versions in package manager?
* Maybe:
  * Server-side: ‚ÄúWhen publishing a new package, you can only use the latest stable version of top-level dependencies‚Äù? -> Would this put upward pressure?
  * Client-side: ‚ÄúWhen installing X, if dependency Y is vulnerable, then update to Y+1‚Äù
* ‚ÄúLog4j version X is vulnerable, therefore your app is vulnerable‚Äù is often a false statement.
* DavidW: That may be true but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to determine. It‚Äôs usually cheaper to update than do the analysis given the presence of dynamic loads, execs, etc.
* Tree-shaking can help - if you remove the code & it‚Äôs THAT code that is vulnerable, then you can show it‚Äôs not there.
  * DavidW: That definitely could help. Doesn‚Äôt work when the vulnerability is something missing.
* DavidW: Also, it‚Äôs a code smell, if there are lots of known vulnerable components, then that suggests the risk is higher even if those components aren‚Äôt exploitable in context.
* OpenSSF ‚Äúpackage manager working group‚Äù very likely being formed shortly. We should talk to them about this -> maybe they can drive it.
* TODO: We should summarize this discussion, high level proposal, etc. and liaise with the new working group?
* Alternate viewpoint:
* Matt R: Don‚Äôt mess with reproducibility, determinism -> Don‚Äôt make these decisions for me, will cause breakage.
  * Would an optional ‚Äú--be-more-secure-at-expense-of-determinism‚Äù flag? Or an override file, etc.
* DavidW: I agree that determinism is important, but I think you can have both. Maybe generate the overrides first, so that it‚Äôs deterministic & then all tests can use the same (known) overrides.	
* We need things deterministic.
* Since Dependabot already does this in many cases, we should connect with GitHub on challenges ‚Äì they probably have a better understanding of what‚Äôs keeping devs from pulling in updates.
* Compromise w/ transitive dependencies? (manicode / twitter)
* Also: listing of tooling, services, etc.
* Microsoft SCITT (was SCIM)
* Let‚Äôs create a proposal to send elsewhere, at least for deterministic overrides of known vulnerable components that can still be tested, etc., before deployment.
* Future of metrics.openssf.org 
* Thank you to Vinod, Jay, Christine, and Azeem for driving this. They‚Äôre trying to determine what the future will be (strategically). E.g., aggregation of security metrics - LFX, scorecards, where? Will try to meet over the next few days.
* DavidW: There should be an aggregation of security metrics of OSS components, it should cover all OSS (eventually), & there should be an API to acquire that data. Some metrics may not be available for all OSS (e.g., due to limits of CPUs available).
* Alpha-Omega
* We‚Äôre starting to interview people. Have 4 interviewees, working on the next 2 weeks.
* First Alpha engagement to be announced soon!
* Charter Update ([https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/CHARTER.md](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/CHARTER.md))
* At the least, state scope & lead(s). The charter said ‚ÄúTSC‚Äù but no one has one, we can make those updates, but at least do scope & leads.
* TODO: Mike owns this work.
* OpenSSF Day FYI

* Luigi did a dry run
* Key: We need to note that the difference here is that is *machine-readable*. It‚Äôs not only for OSS; much applies to anything.
* Minor typo -> tweet from Mark Cox looks like some of the text got jumbled at the end. (if that‚Äôs what he posted, fine, but need to double-check)
* Another mitigation for false information: Since it‚Äôs maintained by project, & projects normally use SCM tools like git & GitHub, it‚Äôll be recorded who proposed the false info
* Thought -> Talk to GitHub to see whether they‚Äôd expose/integrate this with their UI (similar to Security Policy and Licensing magic).
* Help Wanted:
* Communicate with Alpha projects
* Web page for generating / read YAML
* There‚Äôs yaml schema - it‚Äôd be good to document instructions on how to validate the yaml file against it (scorecards could automate that, could be on the page). [https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec/blob/master/security-insights-schema-1.0.0.yaml](https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec/blob/master/security-insights-schema-1.0.0.yaml)

* [https://onsitego.com/blog/google-docs-markdown-editing/](https://onsitego.com/blog/google-docs-markdown-editing/)
* To use, Tools > Preferences to spot a new ‚ÄúAutomatically detect Markdown‚Äù setting followed by ‚Äúenable auto correcting‚Äù 
* This doesn‚Äôt by itself enable generation of markdown (our preference for saving to GitHub) - so not as helpful for our purposes, but feel free to use it
* David: Any update on data aggregation, that is, metrics.openssf.org / LFX / etc. yet?
* _Michael Scovetta: Owner needed to drive this_
* Metrics.openssf.org created first. Scorecards.dev , deps.dev, LFX
* Michael Scovetta doesn‚Äôt have time to update metrics.openssf.org.
* We don‚Äôt need to cannibalize ourselves, we just want a metrics aggregation site.
* Metrics.openssf.org gathers data:
* Scorecards		1M projects - getting raw data from Google‚Äôs BigData table
* Criticality_Score	100k projects - csv also from google
* Badge Program	4.5k projects - Using best practices‚Äô API
* Security Reviews	50 projects - from github/clone of security-reviews
* Deps.dev does their own thing.
* OpenHub doesn‚Äôt seem to be very alive (anyone?) - [https://www.openhub.net/](https://www.openhub.net/)
* CHAOSS has defined metrics, has some tools but the data is focused on a smaller set of projects.
* David: I‚Äôd love to help or lead, but I‚Äôm overwhelmed right now, so it‚Äôll take a little time (weeks) before I can really work on it.
* Need to have conversations with:
* Deps.dev
* Scorecards
* Lfx & LFX security
* Look into openhub, CHAOSS, etc.
* Use case: A developer wants some functionality & is looking for a package to do some function X; we want that developer to get information about that project‚Äôs risks (to encourage the developer to choose a less-risky one, or to investigate further if their only/selected option is risky).
* Secondary use case: A project wants to know how it‚Äôs doing security-wise, & those reports will encourage progress
* Eventually integrate into repos, maybe a browser plug-in, etc.
* Take a few days, if you‚Äôre interested, ping Michael Scovetta! <[michael.scovetta@microsoft.com](mailto:michael.scovetta@microsoft.com) or on slack>
* Discussion: We have a lot of systems continuing to use known vulnerable components., e,g., log4j
* What can we do to reduce the threat?
* Continue discussion next time

* Talking with OpenSSF Scorecards about what it would take to use, are discussing threat model.
* [https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec](https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec)
* Security Reviews
* ~~SCIM/~~SCITT integration?
* SCITT is intended to be an assertion database - claims about a ‚Äútarget‚Äù‚Äù SCITT is the new SCIM. SCITT is intended to be an ‚Äúassertion database‚Äù of claims about a target. E.g., ‚ÄúGitHub has asserted that scanning was done‚Äù. This is in very early stage, not fleshed out.
* SCITT is probably being run by Kay Williams
* [https://github.com/microsoft/scim](https://github.com/microsoft/scim)
* Perhaps we should revisit in a few months
* Future of metrics.openssf.org, scorecards. Suspect that current Grafana approach isn‚Äôt the best long-term approach. That said, there‚Äôs value in aggregation: security scorecards.dev, LFX Security, many other options
* Current plan is to keep metrics.openssf.org running until its replacement is up
* LFX Insights does provide some of this information, has lots of nice UI
* Key concerns: LFX would need to be modified:
* Support arbitrary projects (it mostly just supports LF projects today)
* Support projects without requiring opt-in
* Personal privacy - talk with Aeva Black (who would like to be in discussions about that)
* Deps.dev has lots of interesting data - it might great under there too
* Scorecards.dev
* Next steps: Mike Scovettea will talk with Google, scorecards, LFX, etc., create a high-level plan
* Alpha-Omega Update

* Will start monthly meetings, first is April 6, 2022, (see OpenSSF calendar), that will be the formal detachment of Alpha-Omega from this WG
* Jossef - project proposal
* Currently developers use Google (& other search engines) to find specific code solutions as an exploration process, often ending up at StackOverflow to see the details.
* Problem: Great tools like deps.dev, etc., aren‚Äôt part of this flow.
* Proposal: Simple browser extension to provide summaries about packages being considered.
* E.g., detect reference to a package, e.g., if StackOverflow says ‚Äúpip install XXX‚Äù, or there‚Äôs a hyperlink to a package
* Then display information about the project, e.g., scorecards, best practices badge, deps.dev, etc.
* The big challenge: Getting developers to install this browser extension
* As an experiment, at least, it could help
* How can we encourage? Well, if it‚Äôs OSS & well-maintained that helps. For many their mindset is ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a flow‚Äù
* Branding can help encourage people (OpenSSF and/or LF branding)
* Which browsers?
* ‚ÄúAll of the common ones‚Äù: Chrome-based, Firefox, Safari
* Alternative: Plug-in for dev tools: Visual studio, vim, etc.; package managers.
* OpenSSF requires license to be Apache 2.0, MIT, or GB approval
* Good to go forward as incubating project within this WG; formally distributing it as a a recommended extension from the OpenSSF will require vetting
* Other business

*  (from a security researcher perspective)
* Important, we want repeatable well-articulated process

* Examples of bad reports:
* Entitlement. ‚ÄúI sent you an email, I expect a million dollars‚Äù
* Not-a-vulnerability. E.g., source code is visible, your email address is visible, your website has a spelling error
* Ridiculous timeframes: ‚ÄúI expect you to fix this tonight‚Äù - yes, don‚Äôt delay forever, but it takes time
* Bullying. ‚ÄúYou better do this or else I‚Äôll sue‚Äù. Approach a project with a spirit of helping them fix the problem‚Äù

Agenda



* Remember to record
* New joiners?
* LFX Security, metrics.openssf.org, scorecard.dev, etc.
* Driver: Some folks were getting confused on metrics.openssf.org data discrepancies.
* Scorecard needs a searchable, maintained environment. Add search wrappers around the data source. Scorecard.dev for just the scorecard data.
* David: We should be deliberate about the sites we maintain ‚Äì do we need N sites doing the similar/same thing? Is LFX Security going to support ‚Äúall‚Äù OSS projects?
* Goal: We need an aggregation UI -> Add multiple sources, including non-OpenSSF data sources.
* Metrics.openssf.org: It‚Äôs useful to have a single dashboard that collects all metrics for ALL OSS projects, but for that to work we need someone for whom it‚Äôs their job to maintain it, doesn‚Äôt need to be full-time.
* There are benefits to keeping the data sources separate, and then aggregating.
* A=Things that are already in scorecard
* B=Things that aren‚Äôt today, but could be added.
* C=Things that can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt ever be added to scorecard.
* If C is big, then we need an aggregation on top of it. Else maybe we could pursue B and make ‚Äúscorecard.dev‚Äù the replacement for metrics.openssf.org. Or maybe deps.dev => Maybe this joins OpenSSF?.
* Deps.dev has lots of great info - it‚Äôs currently only language-level packages. It could be extended, though it currently only looks at packages not source repos, that would be a big change.
* Future data sources (potential):
* SCIM (or whatever SCIM eventually becomes)
* Sigstore?
* SBOM?
* ‚ÄúTell me about this OSS software‚Äù Needs:
* API interface - can request info on a package & get that info
* In general it provides data to the public (exception: not-yet-fixed vulnerabilities)
* Enable end-users/developers to ask, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using or thinking about using this package, tell me everything about it to help me make a good decision to use/stop using/take added risk mitigation steps‚Äù
* Needs to cover all OSS software (language level, system level, container images, etc.), include package & source repo info
* Not be specific to any one source repo (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) or package registry/repo (PyPI, npm.etc)
* Include as many metrics sources as reasonable: scorecards, criticality_score, link to any known security reviews, best practices badge, commit activity graphs, # committers/maintainers, known vulnerabilities, ‚Äúis this reproducible‚Äù, etc., to help its users make good decisions
* Handle naming challenges (e.g., ‚Äúzlib‚Äù refers to many different projects - make it possible to search, but if you have something more specific like a URL or pURL or CPE, then it can connect to that specifically)
* Have hyperlinks to ‚Äúmore information‚Äù (e.g., specific outputs from metrics), to let users learn more & verify it
* Would like this to be an OpenSSF investment (not A-O), funded/committed long-term
* Implementation is released as OSS
* Alternative: Maybe target npm, nuget, pypi, rubygems to integrate these metrics into the project page -> couple key metrics + link to ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù?
* Good to target, but they won‚Äôt want constant change. Maybe add a few links (scorecard, badge, etc., and a link to a site with more info)
* Vinod: How many dev actually look at the website vs. ‚Äònpm install foo‚Äô from CLI or IDE, especially for newer versions.
* Big orgs often have their own copy of a repo, smaller orgs generally don‚Äôt
* Maybe target the cli too?
  
npm install foo

WARN foo is not actively maintained [scorecard]

* How can we decide next? Like to hear from Shubhra (LFX) - but will LFX support *ALL* OSS?
* **Action: Mike S. to set up call with Azeem, Abhishek, David, Shubhra, <add your name here if you‚Äôd like me to include you>**
* Alpha-Omega

* Sign up for announcement mailing list if you‚Äôre interested, [https://lists.openssf.org/g/openssf-announcements/](https://lists.openssf.org/g/openssf-announcements/)
* We‚Äôre looking to hire! Think ‚ÄúCEO of a startup‚Äù (product manager) of Alpha-Omega, ‚Äúmake this successful‚Äù - suggestions? Let Mike know!!
* Looking for project managers, security engineers, etc.
* Still working on details
* Again: Webinar is coming up, sign up!!
* Security-insights.yml - early proposal
* Are these about obsolete packages?
* Luigi: YAML file to contain information about the project: contact information, info about CI, pentest, etc. Have tried to standardize the file. Apache Software Foundation noted that their security policies are recorded in a different place, this .yml file could provide information about where things are if they aren‚Äôt in ‚Äúexpected‚Äù places, etc., to help scanner. Scanner can decide to trust or not.
* Nobody has committed to use it. Scorecards is worried about using it, and it doesn‚Äôt provide much info of use to the badging project at this time. We need to make sure that this format will get used, not just created :-). We need ‚Äúwriters & readers‚Äù of the file.
* Security Reviews
* ‚ÄúSecurity Researchers: Don‚Äôt be a jerk‚Äù follow-up?

Agenda



* US White House meeting on open source software - questions? Summary:
* Went well
* Most participants focused on the right things
* Readout: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/)
* LF presented a summary of some key areas that need to be addressed
* Needs to be international (not a US-only problem)
* Trying to get more participation, funding
* metrics.openssf.org (Mike)
* Move of DNS seems to have worked to OpenSSF subscription, rebuilt, updated
* Have updated scorecards results, 1M results
* Scorecard v4 has been ingested
* Homepage loads slowly because it lacks index, will fix over weekend
* Intend to eventually move out to LFX Security instead of running own infrastructure, directionally right way to go, but existing site will probably run ~6 months. Brian & Jim want to expand LFX beyond LF projects.
* Security Insights (Luigi)
* [https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01A50B978T/p1642375922004600](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01A50B978T/p1642375922004600)
* Minimal Example: [https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec/blob/master/examples/security-insights-minimal-sample.yml](https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec/blob/master/examples/security-insights-minimal-sample.yml)

* Is there a way we can modify this so the Best Practices badge can read in some of this? The key is that there needs to be an option for some ‚Äújustification‚Äù text for various fields. See:
* [https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1.json](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1.json)
* https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1
* Security Reviews (Amir)
* Put link to overview.md in readme
* Good session with Dylan, fixed up validator issues
* Split up actions into separate compartments. Had to modify GitHub workflow, because validators should happen on all pull requests but we can‚Äôt have the same flow try to edit external repos (e.g., for overview table).
* Auto-update overview table is working and is DEPLOYED/DONE! Not clear if it works on any push by just Amir, or for any - need to test.
* GREAT STUFF!
* Alpha-Omega (Hiring imminent)
* NPM/colors/faker
* Own developer self-sabotaged (denial of service attack)
* Trusted developer becoming malicious is rare but this isn‚Äôt a first, & is harder to defend against
* Apps can counter by pinning dependencies (libraries shouldn‚Äôt pin though)
* Test before shipping!
* For many developers this is a labor of love (volunteers)
* Wheeler: Just a little over 50% are paid to develop OSS, per Harvard survey. Of course, that means a little under 50% are volunteers. It depends on the project
* Maven, for example, is believed to be volunteers only
* v.Next of [threats paper](https://aka.ms/oss-ecosystem-threats)?
* Probably low priority at this point, unless someone wants to jump in.

Agenda:



* Remember to start recording
* Welcome new members
* Log4j
* What would have countered this / found it earlier?
* Training/education
* OpenSSF training materials specifically tell developers to avoid such constructs
* OpenSSF released ‚ÄúSecure Software Development Fundamentals‚Äù, Free courses on how to develop secure software, released 2020-10-29, Course specifically warns about this construct: ‚Äú... *be very careful* about letting untrusted users control the output formats (that is, using format strings and templates from untrusted users). In many cases, you should *not* let untrusted users set output formats that are used by general-purpose templating systems without carefully validating them first. Some output format systems can execute arbitrary code‚Ä¶ and you *definitely* should not allow that in most cases‚Äù (section ‚ÄúFormat Strings and Templates‚Äù)
* Security audit
* Likely would have found this
* Fuzzing
* Involves sending ‚Äúrandom‚Äù data to see if it triggers a problem
* Various techniques (e.g., coverage-guided fuzzing, dictionaries, etc.) improve effectiveness
* (Maybe) Negative testing
* Nearly 8000 functional tests - but need negative tests
* Less certain because this specific case would have needed to be created
* More broadly: Java / Java‚Äôs JNDI allowed ‚Äúdownload & run arbitrary code from the Internet‚Äù made this MUCH more serious
* Need to disable dangerous mechanisms by default.
* All developers make mistakes, but we need to reduce likelihood/impacts of those mistakes
* Failure to update from 1.X to 2.X - so were already vulnerable to a different vulnerability AND 1.X is unsupported
* It‚Äôd be good to improve fuzzing: make it easier to add to CI pipeline, increase likelihood for fuzzing to find this?
* Would CodeQL existing rules found this?
* [https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-jndi-injection/](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-jndi-injection/)
* Clearly a SAST tool _could_ have found this in theory using taint tracking, it‚Äôs not clear any existing SAST tool before its revelation _would_ have found it.
* ShiftLeft has a graph to query (like codeQl) using a CLI/shell [https://docs.shiftleft.io/home](https://docs.shiftleft.io/home) 
* Metric Dashboard Revamp (Mike)
* Metrics.openssf.org - will be moved to openssf subscription (instead of Mike‚Äôs personal), refresh periodically automatically :-)
* [https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Metrics](https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Metrics) ‚Üê open issues for requests
* Alpha-Omega (Mike)
* Demo to happen a little later in meeting
* Security Insights (Luigi)
* No updates, next week -> doc and linter
* [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/scripts/validate.py](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/scripts/validate.py)
* [https://ossf.github.io/security-reviews/quickstart.html](https://ossf.github.io/security-reviews/quickstart.html)
* Security Reviews (Amir)
* Dylan has an automated tool to generate the index / overview
* David: For permissions, Mike Scovetta can probably do it, if not, talk to Jenn Bonner <[jbonner@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:jbonner@linuxfoundation.org)> - never mind, Mike Scovetta fixed it
* Any other business (please add)

Agenda:



* Remember to start recording
* Welcome new members
* Project Updates (Amir, Dilan)
* Security Reviews
* Added flux (link: [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/reviews/fluxcd/flux2.md](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/reviews/fluxcd/flux2.md))
* Improvements to overview table by Dilan (to be generated and updated automatically)
* Auto update the repo 
* Mike to make Amir owner of the repo.
* Alpha-Omega (Mike)
* Quick update from Securing Critical Projects wg (Amir/David): First cut of ‚ÄúCritical List‚Äù created
* Work in progress - Improvements to come
* Focus on curation from community/workgroup/OpenSSF
* Asynchronous commenting/voting 
* [Security.yaml](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hqks2J0wVqS_YFUQeIyjkLneLfo3_9A-pbU-7DZpGwM/edit#) (Luigi)
* Initial schema available
* David: Need to review, in particular, want to make it simple to ingest as potential input to CII Best Practices badge
* **Decision: For v1, security.yaml will be an input to tools (for tools to consume), and not something that is to be generated *by* tools. Okay to mention that in the future it might be expanded to be an output from tools, but that‚Äôs TBD.**
* Proposed standard name: **SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yaml** in the project root directory or doc/ or docs/.
* Scorecards Comments (David) - interest, but concerned because they generally don‚Äôt want to trust claims made by developers. They instead want automation of ‚Äúwhat is really going on‚Äù (‚Äútruth‚Äù). Might be willing to accept at less than perfect confidence (they rate 0..10, give it say ‚Äú5‚Äù instead of ‚Äú10‚Äù if the only rationale is the insights file), not certain. Another approach would be report two values (‚Äúaccept vs. ignore developer attestations‚Äù), but there were concerns that would be too complicated for many users.
* Michael: Of course currently Scorecards is pretty easy to fool today - they often just check presence of files, not contents.
* David: True. but that‚Äôs what they currently implement. I suspect that they hope long-term to do more analysis, being improved over time.
* Michael: Apache commented that scorecard doesn‚Äôt understand a lot of things - Apache does them, but differently. CII Best Practices badge has the same issue, our CI pipeline isn‚Äôt found because we use circleci instead of GitHub Actions.
* Discussion about forks: Maybe identify ‚Äúfork of‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚Äúrepo maintained at‚Äù to deal with project forks vs. forks that aren‚Äôt project forks.
* Need to limit what we put in there.
* David A. Wheeler: I‚Äôm going to be busy with the Great MFA Distribution Project for the rest of the month, I intend to pick up these other things once that gets less crazy :-).
* Other topics

* Project Updates
* [Project Alpha/Omega](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u7Ps18dzu9M-HF7ZHTK6VB5jLaVJvnw6uq3o7qw5yGE/edit?usp=sharing) [this working group is acting as its starting point]
* Finalizing 2022 operating plan, press release, initial set of roles to hire.
* (Alpha) The Critical Projects WG will own ‚Äúthe list‚Äù of most-critical projects. - Tentatively, a draft list will be available on/around Dec 2 (derived from a merge of multiple sources) for the Great MFA Distribution Project (who have a tight deadline); that can be improved over time:
* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit#gid=0)
* (Omega) Microsoft will be contributing an internal project to OpenSSF to seed Omega (and itself be open sourced).
* Container image ‚ÄúToolshed‚Äù with ~20 security tools pre-installed and a script to execute them and normalize the results.
  
![image](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/assets/128058721/8d3523c3-85b3-4775-b8c5-58e9b11e0b05)
  



* Batch infrastructure to run the image against OSS projects at scale (queues, auto-scaling, etc.)
* (Omega) Finalizing ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù license agreement to use CodeQL in an unrestricted capacity (e.g. scanning packages directly) for scanning Open Source Software (currently it only allows scanning if it‚Äôs on GitHub).
* Alpha/Omega will eventually be moved out to a separate working group.
* Security Reviews - [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews)
* OSSF-SECURITY.yaml
* For v1, this will be an input to other tools (e.g. created by the maintainer, possibly wizard-assisted).
* ‚ÄúHow Not To Report Security Vulnerabilities‚Äù
* Anecdotes: Some security researchers approach projects with demands -- ‚Äúhere is my thing -- fix it and give me a CVE by <date> or I‚Äôll go public and tell everyone how much you suck.‚Äù Reports of folks being threatened, berated, insulted, etc. Maybe security researchers think the recipient is a nameless drone, but often they‚Äôre a volunteer (even for the largest projects) and this is really becoming a problem. Maybe reach out to some commercial organizations too -- ‚Äúthey‚Äôre people, too.‚Äù At the same time, try to get the other side of the story from some vuln reporters -- e.g. ‚ÄúI was strung along for 18 months, no bounty as promised, and told I couldn‚Äôt disclose either.‚Äù
* Previous articles: Talk to CRob.
  
* I‚Äôd suggest:
* Survey some projects, large and small -- I suppose the ones with a reasonable number of CVEs -- ask them about their experiences in getting reports -- what works well, what doesn‚Äôt -- if they could change one thing, etc.
* Write up the results and publish a blog -- maybe some do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt‚Äôs -- maybe a few stories, either real or anonymized, etc.
* Work with the Vulnerability Disclosures working group.
* Suggestion: Ask Vulnerability Disclosures WG to write some sort of ‚ÄúSecurity Researchers: Don‚Äôt be a jerk‚Äù article/paper aimed at researchers
* Could ask a student or org to do a survey (LF Research can also run surveys, depending on what‚Äôs decided)
* Saying ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt fix it within a reasonable time I‚Äôll post it publicly‚Äù is perfectly fine; what‚Äôs not fine trying to extort other things such as doxing people, ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù agreements that are basically extortion payoffs, ‚Äúbug bounties‚Äù that were not promised, etc.
* Be especially careful when a researcher asks for money if there‚Äôs no existing bug bounty program, that can easily appear extortionate.
* Owner wanted!
* Drew Davidson, Lorenzo De Carli

  
* Next Steps:
  * Reach out to [Vulnerability Disclosures WG](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C019Y2A28Q6), CRob to sync and take it from there.
* Updates to typosquatting tool: [https://github.com/microsoft/OSSGadget/tree/main/src/oss-find-squats-lib/Mutators](https://github.com/microsoft/OSSGadget/tree/main/src/oss-find-squats-lib/Mutators)

* Multiple boss issue - need to know who in end the lead reports to (GB probably)
* Need to determine *who* decides what projects are in Alpha (expect it to be a small group, selected by GB + leads, informed by quantitative data)
* Identify examples of data / software types to consider to identify critical projects, so that those at least are considered:
* Harvard Study (Census II), Census I, OSTIF‚Äôs list, etc. - see critical projects WG
* May be useful in Omega to use a static analysis tool aggregator

Attendance (please add yourself):



* Michael Scovetta (Microsoft)
* Dilan Bhalla (Microsoft)
* Amir Montazery (OSTIF)
* Matt Rutkowski, he/him, CT (IBM)

Agenda:



* Metrics Dashboard / Hiring Status
* No updates, lower priority, revisit after November when things cool down.
* [Alpha-Omega](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u7Ps18dzu9M-HF7ZHTK6VB5jLaVJvnw6uq3o7qw5yGE/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Plan] TAC approval next week
* [Plan] GB approval ($) early October
* [Plan] Public announce early November
* Biggest changes in past few weeks:
* **Alpha** -> Use an external service provider to do the actual day-to-day work. OpenSSF would manage the list of projects, specific deliverables, etc. but generally stay out of the direct engagement / analysis stuff.
* Outputs: Writeup, SCIM entry, ‚ÄúWe did a review of this part of zlib, found 3 issues, all fixed in v.1.2.3‚Äù
* **Omega** -> Leverage LFX Security for the triage portal. OpenSSF still needs to figure out the analysis part and response workflow.
* SCIM => ‚Äúzlib was scanned by <x> and no critical vulnerabilities were found‚Äù. ‚ÄúFoo v1.1.3 was scanned by <x> and one critical vulnerability was found.‚Äù
* Where <x> is:
  * ‚ÄúThe OpenSSF analysis toolchain‚Äù => 
  * CodeQL
  * Greppers
  * ‚Ä¶
* Container => has all the tools pre-installed, kickoff script, etc.
* Alpha: Need list of top 100 projects
* Mike to take 100 from criticality
* Sheet: [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YDd9tCDyBrzA6F_xmkx8atwT3Bam46f5IH33mmUM24A/edit?usp=sharing)

<h2>2021-09-01 Meeting</h2>


Attendance (please add yourself):



* Michael Scovetta (Microsoft)
* Dilan Bhalla (Microsoft)
* Matt Rutkowski, he/him, CT (IBM)
* David A. Wheeler (Linux Foundation)
* Amir Montazery (OSTIF)
* Ryan Haning (Microsoft)

Agenda:



* David: We should include security-feeds (looking for malicious packages) in the metrics.openssf.org dashboard
* How can we improve indexing of security audit reports so that other tools, in particular security scorecards, can more easily use that information? See: [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/issues/58](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/issues/58)
* The metrics dashboard is already live & already has an API. The easy way is to query the metrics dashboard
* [https://metrics.openssf.org/api/1/get-project?package_url=pkg:npm/left-pad](https://metrics.openssf.org/api/1/get-project?package_url=pkg:npm/left-pad)
* 
* [Alpha-Omega](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u7Ps18dzu9M-HF7ZHTK6VB5jLaVJvnw6uq3o7qw5yGE/edit?usp=sharing) next steps
* David Wheeler: Should the CII Best Practices badge add a link to metrics.openssf.org from each project, so that readers can see ‚Äúother stats about this project‚Äù?
* No objections
* [SECURITY.yaml](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hqks2J0wVqS_YFUQeIyjkLneLfo3_9A-pbU-7DZpGwM/edit?usp=sharing) ongoing discussion
* Name of filename - changed (for now at least)
* Naming concern: is SECURITY.yaml confusing? Naming matters - it‚Äôs the first thing everyone will see.
* Symfony uses the name for something else: [https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/security.html](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/security.html)
* Matt: I think it should have ‚Äúopenssf‚Äù in the name
* David: I don‚Äôt think the filename should should have openssf in the name, because people might think the using project is from OpenSSF.
* Proposed new name: OSSF-SECURITY.yaml - this is at least unique. We can change it later.
* We need to have more working sessions specifically focused on this, say 1/week. Need to get Best Practices WG & Scorecards folks involved. (CII Best Practices badge mailing list maybe as well).
* We need a *short* description (few paragraphs) of what this is supposed to do, get into the current draft doc. We‚Äôll work on the current Google doc‚Äôs intro.
* Send out Doodle poll to set up new time late next week. Next Monday is a US holiday. Weekly meetings to complete.

<h2>2021-08-04 Meeting</h2>


Attendance (please add yourself):



* Michael Scovetta (Microsoft)
* David A. Wheeler (Linux Foundation)

Agenda:



* Welcome new folks! - We are recording.
* Security Reviews
* No major updates
* Mike to update PR from Feb (dependency confusion), probably just close.
* NOTE: Below are notes from today. A separate draft document has been created ‚ÄúProject security information specification‚Äù at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hqks2J0wVqS_YFUQeIyjkLneLfo3_9A-pbU-7DZpGwM/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hqks2J0wVqS_YFUQeIyjkLneLfo3_9A-pbU-7DZpGwM/edit#)
* SECURITY.md
* Most important: How do I report a vuln I find?
* Second most: Security / assurance information -- ‚ÄúWhy do I think it‚Äôs secure?‚Äù -- ‚ÄúAssurance Case‚Äù
* Roadmap: Where do I go definitively go to get information -- Connecting with the broad picture
* Information used by automated tools
* David W: It‚Äôs important that it be SIMPLE. If it‚Äôs too complicated, people won‚Äôt do it
* Profiles => Minimum, extend beyond this over time
* Could generate some SBOM data, Scorecard data, etc. from this
* See also: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/issues/19](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/issues/19)

Fields:

* Parent SECURITY.whatever => Apache Foundation vs. Apache Projects scenario.
* Parent SBOM => link?
* Yes/No: Do you have a security.md file in your repo?
* Vulnerability Reporting - how to report a vulnerability
* Mechanism: email, web, etc. -- an enum here
* Value : actual email address(es), url to go to to report, etc.
* Encryption keys (where available) for encrypting data to send: PGP, etc.
* Security Policy: link (url)
* Current security practices - could provide ‚Äúoverriding‚Äù data for security evaluations (such as Security Scorecard, CII Best Practices, SLSA), though there‚Äôs the issue of ‚Äúcan you trust this‚Äù (also: enable including ‚Äújustification‚Äù text & URLs that link to evidence/arguments)
* Link to assurance case (documentation on ‚Äúwhy you think it‚Äôs secure‚Äù)
* SAST:
* [
* Implementation type (ad hoc, CI, etc.)
* Tool
* Ruleset
* Additional tool policies (e.g. ‚Äúonly high/critical‚Äù)
* Links to evidence ‚Üê maybe this is a general field for all others?
* ]
* DAST: (same)
* Contribution Policy
* Who can contribute (PR)
* Who can become a maintainer?
* Source code release process
* Links to other information about the package
* Security Scorecard
* Metrics.openssf.org
* CII Best Practices badge
* Distribution Points:
* Package Ecosystems (purl)
* Dependency Inclusion Methods (e.g. NPM, /vendor, copy/paste source)
* Package identifiers
* CPE (meh.)
* Package URLs (preferred)
* Branch Strategy:
* Tag == version
* Only ‚Äòmain‚Äô used.
* Software Bill of Material (SBOM)
* URLs to SBOMs (how to find SBOM for a given version)
* Project Lifecycle Stage (dev, prod, retiring, archived/dormant, etc.)
* SLSA Data:
* Build - [Hermetic](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/blob/main/docs/requirements.md#hermetic) : ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù?
* etc.
* Has to be easy to consume by tooling.
* Threat Model
* Verification tooling (similar to security-reviews) to ensure proper format, etc.
* Completeness, broken links, etc.
* Sanity check / lie detector - what‚Äôs the evidence that this data is correct / trustworthy?
* Form Wizard -> template, etc. so that humans can fill it out.
* Date of data (when was this file last updated?)
* Bug bounties (details? Or just point to URL?)

Need a ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù - this would primarily be a collection of justification text / links. Maybe a ‚Äúfirst cut‚Äù of this file is generated automatically, and then humans update it to provide the full set of information.

For all things:



* Field name
* Value claimed
* Justification text (‚Äúwhy is this the correct value?‚Äù) (issue: what natural language used? en, fr, zh-CN, etc.)
* Evidence URL(s) [may have arguments as well]

Who would use this & how?

* Security researchers (for reporting vulns)
* Security measurement/evaluation systems (CII Best Practices badge, Security Scorecard, SLSA, metrics.openssf.org, SBOMs, etc.) - provide data they can directly consume/use to measure, so that potential users can quickly evaluate to determine risks
* Enterprises / security/risk compliance - ‚Äúwhat are the outliers?‚Äù, transitive risk (sub-dependencies)
* ‚Äúnpm check-policy --profile=standard foo‚Äù => ‚ÄúAccording to the standard profile, foo should implement SAST but they state they don‚Äôt‚Äù (or alternatively, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no evidence in XYZ that they do‚Äù)?
* **Next Steps:**
* Iterate on the fields above.
* Think about a minimum profile
* Wire format - JSON or YAML, does it matter?
  

Probably yaml-based.



* Metrics Dashboard
* Hiring
* TODO: Job Description
  
* New Project Idea: ‚ÄúSecurity Triage Portal‚Äù
* Problems: Each tool generates different output, often difficult to correlate/analyze at scale (especially ‚Äúsame rule across 1000s of projects‚Äù). Security researchers don‚Äôt have great options here to exploring results at scale. Limited data affects ML model creation. Naturally high HP rate of tools.
* Solution:
* Create a security tool triage experience (tool-agnostic) to take in findings, references to source code, etc., providing security researchers a power-user way to explore, correlate, mark, triage, comment, tag, monitor, etc. 
* Tradeoff between how visible/public data is.
* 90 days for project to access it?
* Which tools? Licenses?
* Is this worth putting time into?
* Examine code to look for attack vectors, recommend tooling to identify actual issues?

* Dilan Bhalla
* Luigi Gubello
* Matt Rutkowski (IBM)

* Parris Lucas (@GrooveCS)

Agenda:



* Welcome new folks! - We are recording.
* Security Reviews
* Amir cleaned up things
* Kevin Backhouse created a new review, nice article on Fail2Ban. What was the problem with it per [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/pull/55](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/pull/55) (Fail2Ban)? Has this been fixed for the future?
* [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/validate.py](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews/blob/main/validate.py)
* If the metadata is wrong it fails the test.
* There‚Äôs a profanity filter, but it‚Äôs ‚Äúlike a caffeinated puppy‚Äù (need training) - there was a bug & it got fixed.
* This was an organically-created review, we hadn‚Äôt heard from him before.
* David A. Wheeler: ‚ÄúThis is a small success, but it‚Äôs a success!‚Äù
* Metrics Dashboard

* Maybe we should ask scorecard to be more general:
* SECURITY.{txt,html} as well as SECURITY.md
* doc[s]/SECURITY.{md,txt,html}
* Support GitLab (at least) in addition to GitHub
* [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/2c2432b9dfbf9490c0aeab5b72300de94ce14617/checks/security_policy.go#L71](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/2c2432b9dfbf9490c0aeab5b72300de94ce14617/checks/security_policy.go#L71)
* Scorecard can view organizations as a whole -e.g. Apache has rigorous practices, therefore all Apache projects meet X, Y, and Z.
* But we should target organizations - easier to get lots of repos to change.

<h2>2021-06-23 Meeting</h2>


Attendance (please add yourself):



* Michael Scovetta (Microsoft)
* David A. Wheeler (Linux Foundation)
* Amir Montazery (OSTIF)
* Ryan Haning (Microsoft)
* Marta Rybczynska (OSTC)
* Dilan Bhalla
* Luigi Gubello

Agenda:



* Welcome new folks! (Try to record - ::sad face::)
* Amir -> [https://ostif.org/a-review-of-the-linux-kernels-release-signing-and-key-management-policies/](https://ostif.org/a-review-of-the-linux-kernels-release-signing-and-key-management-policies/)
* Discussion: How do I sign things in an automated way?
* There are many solutions
* Mike: For OSS Gadget, the pipeline runs in Azure DevOps, it pulls a token from keyvault to authenticate pipeline to authenticate that step.
* David: The OpenSSF digital identity WG is working to improve things. Sigstore, git improvements.
* Organization:
* Project leads needed for each major project:
* Metric Dashboard
* Security Reviews
* [OSS Reproducibility](https://github.com/microsoft/OSSGadget/pull/237)
* Demo
* Tool is OSS Gadget - oss reproducible
* Different strategies are applied to analyze the package
* Package matches source
* Package contained in souce
* Autobuild produces same package
* [https://github.com/microsoft/oryx](https://github.com/microsoft/oryx)
* Suggestions:
* Scoring vs. boolean IsReproducibility
  * 10/10 => bit-for-bit archive match
  * 9/10 => file matches, but not all metadata (dates)
  * 8/10 => files match EXCEPT for some files that are ‚Äúalmost certainly not a problem‚Äù
  * 1/10 => doesn‚Äôt match & can‚Äôt figure out why, might be malicious
  * 0/10 => no source code
* Bucketizing results for risk
* Output results for 25k projects to JSON -> absorb into metric dashboard.
* Maybe make output similar to OSS Scorecard to ease integration? (Might not be a good idea)
* Builds can try permutations to find a match (issue: there may not be enough information to determine the options; it could require significant analysis to find plausible settings)
* Think about emitting SARIF?
* David W: I suggest focusing on language-level (npm, PyPI, etc.). The reproducible-builds.org project is doing a lot of work in Linux distros, but there‚Äôs much less available at language level.
* Recommendation: If different, show a diffoscope result from ‚Äúclosest‚Äù
* Next Steps
* Merging pull https://account.samsung.com/accounts/v1/SDAP/signInGate?response_type=code&client_id=7ev2xxwz18&locale=en&countryCode=GB&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com%2Fuser%2Fv2%2Ftokens%2Faccess%3FreturnUrl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com%2F%3Fsuccess%3D1%26appId%3D7ev2xxwz18&state=BUnHLVVm5wwPgiHSvbiqiEn9kzMFFNd6&goBackURL=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com&acr_values=urn%3Asamsungaccount%3Aacr%3Aaal1&response_type=code&client_id=7ev2xxwz18&locale=en&countryCode=GB&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com%2Fuser%2Fv2%2Ftokens%2Faccess%3FreturnUrl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com%2F%3Fsuccess%3D1%26appId%3D7ev2xxwz18&state=BUnHLVVm5wwPgiHSvbiqiEn9kzMFFNd6&goBackURL=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com&acr_values=urn%3Asamsungaccount%3Aacr%3Aaal1&response_type=code&client_id=7ev2xxwz18&locale=en&countryCode=GB&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com%2Fuser%2Fv2%2Ftokens%2Faccess%3FreturnUrl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com%2F%3Fsuccess%3D1%26appId%3D7ev2xxwz18&state=BUnHLVVm5wwPgiHSvbiqiEn9kzMFFNd6&goBackURL=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacy.samsung.com&acr_values=urn%3Asamsungaccount%3Aacr%3Aaal1 into OSS gadget release
* Implementing suggestions
* Metric Dashboard
* Open Bug: Dashboard not refreshing data
* Github summaries and ‚Äúwatchers‚Äù now included in dashboard, just need to be merged
* Security Reviews
* Funding Progress (for remainder of 2021)
* Request was for ~$80k ($40k for development, $40k for other things)
* TAC currently voting ([https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/59](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/59)) 
* Assuming this goes through, need to move quickly.
* David -> Does LF have support for hiring contractors, or would we need to do this ourselves?
* David: We definitely have support! The main issue is identifying qualified people - please help us! We can do the rest (paying, tax handling, periodic oversight)

* Metric Dashboard
* Discussion on ‚Äòstars‚Äô
* David W: I suggest using ‚Äúwatchers‚Äù instead; watching has a cost, which makes it a more valuable signal. No one knows what ‚Äústars‚Äù are supposed to mean, other than ‚Äúsomeone pressed star‚Äù
* Tracking as [#44](https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Metrics/issues/44).

<h2>2021-04-30 Meeting</h2>

* Jonathan Leitschuh (Gradle)
* Amir Montazery (OSTIF)
* Adrian Wood (Wells Fargo)
* Dilan Bhalla (UC Berkeley)
* Laurent Simon (Google)
* Luigi Gubello (Ospite)
* Ryan Haning (Microsoft)

Agenda:



* Welcome new folks! (We are recording)
* 2021/2022 Budget
* Security Metrics:
* Project Hosting: $200/month (just hosting, not deep analysis)
* Software Development: I‚Äôd like to ballpark this at $120k for 2021/2022, to use for the following:
* Updating the metric dashboard based on updated requirements.
* Creating new metrics calculators
* Integrating new data sources (e.g. CHAOSS).
* Improving the API
* Additional Pool:
* We‚Äôd like $75k for additional projects to be determined throughout 2021/2022, subject to WG and TAC approval as they come up.
* Maybe a triage bounty?
* Metrics Dashboard
* Live at [https://metrics.openssf.org](https://metrics.openssf.org)
* Initial Feedback?
* Additional Metrics?
* Additional Features?
* Bugs? -> [open an issue](https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Metrics/issues/new).
* Blog going out on Monday.
* **Next Time: Go through dashboard and collectively come up with better/new metrics.**
* **Book: How to measure anything in cybersecurity risk.**
* DavidW: Can at least look at ‚Äúpast problems & what might have indicated it‚Äù E.g., see [Backstabber‚Äôs Knife Collection](https://dasfreak.github.io/Backstabbers-Knife-Collection/) paper. One risk is that something may be true for problems with problems & problems that aren‚Äôt, but may still find things. E.g., abnormally short review period. We can discuss this next time..
* Security Reviews
* How can we increase this number?
* Blog going out on Monday.
* Metrics Dashboard & Security Reviews will be a big part of the upcoming OpenSSF Town Hall
* **New Project Idea: reproducible.openssf.org**
* Do you ever wonder whether the package you get _actually_ reflects the source code in the project‚Äôs repository? Have you ever validated this yourself? 
* We can set up a service that takes in a package (Package URL), identifies the source repo and tag, extracts some hints around possible build steps, and attempts to reproduce the package bits from the source.
* Focus on language-level repositories (Python, etc.) where there‚Äôs a single common source for resulting packages
* NPM/left-pad
* TrivialBuildChecker (all files):
* 98.4% of content matches from source repository
* 88.0% of files come from source repository
* TrivialBuildChecker (ignore uninteresting files)
* 100% of content matches from source repository
* 100% of files come from source repository
* Other Info:
* No build scripts detected.
* github.com/madler/zlib@1.2.11
* ConfigureAndMakeChecker
* 100% of content matches
* Where custom build scripts are needed, in the short term, we could build a repo to hold them. In the long term, we could come up with a standard format an encourage authors to include in their repo.
* DavidW: I love the idea. Let‚Äôs make sure that ‚Äúwe could reproduce it (or not)‚Äù shows up on metrics.openssf.org. If the results are NOT equivalent, maybe we could auto-run diffoscope somehow to help determine the problem? The ‚Äúreproducible-builds‚Äù project points to Linux distros that do this, but they currently focus only on packages distributed by Linux distributions: [https://reproducible-builds.org/citests/](https://reproducible-builds.org/citests/)
* There's been talk about creating a new WG on reproducible builds, but it hasn't been created, and if it's created we'll have given them a head start.
* Next Steps: Reach out to Chris Lamb (reproducible builds), learn more about rb.org. We could also link to Chris‚Äô presentation to the critical projects WG DavidW: it was recorded: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlDlVqgndQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlDlVqgndQI)
* **May 3 - Town Hall
**Registration: [https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ITB-KOswQeGEWGl2tq-vCg](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ITB-KOswQeGEWGl2tq-vCg)
* OpenSSF: WG for package managers themselves?
* Ryan to talk to TAC about this.

* Metric Dashboard Demo
* New and improved!
* Data Sources: 106k projects. 2.5M metrics
* Scorecard (existing JSON)
* Best Practices

* All components now run in containers (docker-compose):
* Web Server: Nginx
* Database: PostgreSQL
* App Server: Django/Python
* Cache: Redis
* Remember: We might need to change hostname-ish things to metrics.openssf.org for Grafana and Django.
* Request for David:
  
* Cert will need to say metrics.openssf.org (use Let‚Äôs Encrypt).
* New Topics:
* (Jonathan) Intel feed for threat actors/groups in the supply chain, attacks, etc. Examples: php backdoor incident, dependency confusion, actors publishing malicious packages, etc.
* Include package managers (in OpenSSF?) or at least together somewhere so they can all share valuable information among themselves. Even single ecosystems have multiple implementations (npm / yarn, jcenter/jfrog), etc.
* David Wheeler: That sounds like a ‚ÄúThreat Briefing‚Äù tailored to developers/users of open source software. You might be able to create a brief summary from public materials, e.g., Backstabber‚Äôs Knife Collection paper, Sonatype, Synopsys‚Äô ‚Äú2020 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis‚Äù https://www.synopsys.com ‚Ä∫ 2020-ossra-report, etc.
* Could be funded & go much further, that requires funding
* Action #1: Mike to find out how to connect package management ecosystems -- check w/ Kay, et al. - Maybe a ‚ÄúPackage Management System Working Group‚Äù?
* Action #2: Create space for this discussion to occur - Slack channel?
* Action #3: Add a page on openssf.org with brief summary & links to relevant papers
* (Hard) ‚ÄúUnder Attack? For OSS Projects -> 
* Page on openssf.org, basic info, link to join slack channel -. ‚Äú#helpme‚Äù
  
* **Threats Whitepaper version control follow-up:**
* Markdown version for editing and updating
* Was brought up in Issue #5
* Markdown version is on the repo, currently V1.1
* Markdown version feeds into pandoc .pdf
* "Pretty" version for printing/viewing/sharing
* Major updates get new versions (1.2, 1.3, etc)
* Take into consideration issues/imminent updates
* Issue #18
* Remaining Issues in repo?

Agenda:



* Welcome new folks! (We are recording)
* Demo: Metric Dashboard container
* MVP Description
* Required Features
* Publicly accessible via a simple URL (metrics.openssf.org or similar).
* WIP, need infrastructure and static IP address set up.
* Simple way to identify a package and directly go there:
* E.g. metrics.openssf.org/blah?package_url=pkg:npm/left-pad
* E.g. [metrics.openssf.org/showit?url=https://npmjs.com/left-pa](http://metrics.openssf.org/blah?url=https://npmjs.com/left-pad)d
* metrics.openssf.org/api/1/get-metrics?url=blah
* Maybe do a redirect to an easily caching blob.
* **Done:**
  * /api/1/get-project?url=[https://github.com/geal/nom](https://github.com/geal/nom)
  * /api/1/get-project?package_url=pkg:github/geal/nom
* Landing page with basic info about the project and links to the dashboard, possibly with a list of projects.
* Need to finalize plan for this.
* Add a disclaimer about this being an MVP, 1990-era ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù (animated?) gif.
* **Done**
* Form to add a new project to the index.
* **Done, but currently only mass load jobs are running.**
* Periodic refresh (weekly) and on-demand - it will show when the data was acquired
* **Done, daily refresh via local cron job.**
* MVP Data Sources:
* Everything:
  * Badge
  * Security Scorecard via repeatedly-updated JSON post (https://github.com/ossf/scorecard)
  * Security-Reviews
  * Criticality Score (https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score) - they have a big CSV file
      * Other OSSF initiatives that provide insight into security metrics and practices
  * Link to repo‚Äôs statistics (GitHub/GitLab stat page for that project)
* Per-Project:
  * Releases (GitHub, NPM)
* Metrics:
* Everything from Badge, Scorecard
* Description
* Releases over time
* Security Reviews
  * Show multiple reviews (timestamp), or a message for no review found.
* Remove:
  * Avg Issue Duration
  * % Issues Open
* **Final Grade? (‚ÄúTBD‚Äù)**
  * Is there any pre-existing work on this kind of aggregation? Other than ssllabs? Openhub? https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/ajv-formats
  * Wait until we have some more metrics we‚Äôve discussed
* Not-MVP data to consider:
* Libyears (transitive, sum & average, see average esp.) [https://libyear.com/](https://libyear.com/)
  * I don‚Äôt see a cross-ecosystem tool for this, we should add to OSSGadget.
* ‚ÄúIs it reproducible?‚Äù  - npm ‚Äútbv‚Äù project tries to do this
* API
* Pull back all data for a given project via JSON
  * Done.
* Per-user auth not needed for MVP.
  * OK
* The MVP needs to be reasonably performant under reasonable load.
* Can cache locally (Redis), should be fine.
* Running on a single server is OK, but the individual components must be able to scale out.
* David A. Wheeler: If we can make each different component a different URL, we may be able to use the LF‚Äôs Fastly (CDN) account. That makes a WORLD of difference for scalability - you can handle LOTS of requests with a CDN front end on at least some resources, but it does require that you think about how it‚Äôs accessed (you can tell Fastly when to invalidate a previous cache). This is a big help on the CII Best Practices badge.
* Multiple dashboard editors.
* Everything in GitHub.
* Don‚Äôt forget about caching/CDNs
* New developers must be able to get a new environment created in less than 5 minutes of effort, 15 minutes of time-on-wall.
* If we want to create a pretty document via GitHub, one way is Markdown, then use pandoc to generate PDF \

* Actions:
* David to figure out how to get metrics.openssf.org set up. Mike to provide the destination static IP for this.
* Mike to figure out how to post to OpenSSF youtube channel.



<h2>2021-03-18 Meeting</h2>


Attendance (please add yourself):



* Michael Scovetta (Microsoft)
* Amir Montazery (Open Source Technology Improvement Fund)
* David A. Wheeler (Linux Foundation) 
* Ryan Haning (Microsoft)
* Dilan Bhalla
* John Andersen

Agenda:



* Welcome new folks! (We are recording)
* Talk about the TAC meeting
* Overall it went well
* Each OpenSSF WG has been asked to present to the TAC about their goals, projects, etc. - basically formalizing what we‚Äôre doing, see what each group is doing.
* There were comments that the WG name is a little confusing (‚Äúhave to squint‚Äù)
* LOTS of discussion about how the WGs can work together. There are 3 more WGs to do. We want to get into a rhythm of reports to the TAC
* David: The dashboard has a big potential role as an integrating mechanism - it can bring in data from CII Best Practices badge, Scorecard, reviews, etc., and then provide that data to others (e.g., critical projects WG). But the dashboard needs to mature to be ready for that role.
* Michael S: We need someone paid to do some dev work on the dashboard
* The TAC/GB know that they need to get funding; they‚Äôre working on that.
* What we need right now for the dashboard:
* Dan: Will help document/automate dashboard installation (e.g., so can modify it)
* Mike: I can package it up to make it easy to run (we want both an easy-to-start package (Docker image), and a way to install so you can modify it) - the source code that you run is a mounted image
* Describe the less minimal viable product description -> Exactly what do we want to see in terms of something for launch?
* Mike S. to post a draft.
* TODO: Provide an API to extract the data - raw JSON would be fine
* /api/get-package-list
* /api/get-metadata?package_url=$purl
* POC uses Grafana, which grabs data using SQL queries
* Operational: Vastly increase # projects whose data is collected (& maybe automatically collect some data no matter what, e.g., GitHub data, CII Best Practices badge)
* Pipeline -> Refresh, list of projects, allow to expand to other projects, make it not horrible to add new checks.
* Long-term (NOT MVP): ‚Äúis it reproducible?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat are the results from some security analysis tools?‚Äù - we would like that later (phase 2) though
* David: You can often make little sites scale well with a little caching (CII Best Practices uses Fastly as a CDN; Cloudflare works well)
* POC: You write to the internal data by posting to an API; doing that  writes to the database, you need an API key to make changes. Grafana later uses SQL queries to access data in that database (PostgreSQL).
* PostgreSQL is awesome!
  
* Threat Paper
* Add Dependency Confusion
* Planning for a 2.0 release - brainstorming ideas
* Amir to work on this - look into version control and ideas for 2.0
* Current Version is version 1.1 in Markdown: [wg-identifying-security-threats/Threats, Risks, and Mitigations in the Open Source Ecosystem.md at main ¬∑ ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/publications/threats-risks-mitigations/v1.1/Threats%2C%20Risks%2C%20and%20Mitigations%20in%20the%20Open%20Source%20Ecosystem.md)

* Security Reviews
* Lots of reviews have been approved & merged
* Dashboard technically brings in security reviews, but some things aren‚Äôt working  - Dilan created some patches to fix it & created a pull request
* Security Review Project Blog Post status
* Finish tidying up repo 
* Finishing touches/graphic/presentation element? 
* Discuss at next meeting

* Metrics Dashboard: Next Steps
* [http://openssf-security-dashboard-dev1.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/](http://openssf-security-dashboard-dev1.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/)
* Make it clear on front page that this is an early ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù

* David: Fundamentally this is a vulnerability in the package managers, so it‚Äôs the *package managers* that in the long term need to build in countermeasures to dependency confusion. They need to be secure by default (given a package, there should be only 1 repo considered to download it). This doesn‚Äôt require global namespaces (though that is one way to solve it)
* Bundler (Ruby) is working on this
* What‚Äôs the status of the others?

* We need to be more specific about what can be included
* Make clear your association of what‚Äôs being reviewed & funding sources (are you being paid by the project being evaluated?)
* Opinions okay, but all opinions must be supported by declared facts/analysis (not just opinion)
* Goal: High quality

  * The auditor/reviewer(s) who performed the Security Review must have adequate technical knowledge, training, and proficiency to perform the review. 
  * The auditor/reviewer(s) who performed the Security Review must maintain objectivity and independence in all matters relating to the Security Review. 
  * The auditor/reviewer(s) who performed the Security Review must exercise due professional care in the performance of the Security Review and dissemination of results. 
* Connect metrics dashboard with National Vulnerability Database (NVD) etc. as well, so you can see vulnerability history for yourself
* Aim: Microsoft & OSTIF add their material, clearly write down ‚Äúwhat can be included‚Äù
* Call for contributions
* Move quality bar, etc to the readme.

**Blog Article (Super, Super Draft)**


On a typical day, the open source community publishes over 2,000 new packages, many of which form the foundation of the technology that powers the modern world. Many organizations recognize the security risks associated with such a supply chain, and take action to understand how much risk the open source in use carries.


Individual open source projects are often reviewed by organizations, to identify security weaknesses, health, and the posture of upstream components. Sometimes, these reviews are published, but more often, they are kept within an organization.


The OpenSSF is proud to announce the creation of the [Security Reviews](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews) project, whose mission is to collect and curate a useful set of security reviews performed against open source packages. Through this, we seek to provide two important things:



* A positive indicator of the security quality of a package (‚Äúsomeone reviewed this package didn‚Äôt find anything notable‚Äù)
* Context where vulnerabilities or weaknesses exist (‚Äúvulnerability X only affects this part of the component, or if you use it in this way‚Äù)

The OpenSSF would like to thank <LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS> who have already contributed content to the Security Reviews project, and to <LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS> who have committed to providing content in the near future. We encourage <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> members of the security community to contribute security reviews to this project, and look forward to seeing its value and impact increase over time. For more information, please visit [https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews](https://github.com/ossf/security-reviews).

* Dilan to connect with David to talk details.
* Silas to investigate making a container for the environment setup.
* Metrics.openssf.org - status
* Need to make it clearer *WHY* we‚Äôre doing this!
* Users of these projects: Is this OSS I‚Äôm using (or thinking of using) okay to use? How risky is it to use?
* Customers / Downstream users: Which OSS being transitively included is especially risky and/or needs investment?
* Developers of these projects themselves: Am I doing what I should do to make it secure?
* This applies to *ANY* OSS project - ideally & eventually we‚Äôd have all OSS projects
* Obviously won‚Äôt start there
* We need to make sure that we can legally grab the data we grab
* Why not opt-in?
* We don‚Äôt see any advantage. Then we need a marketing campaign. Start small, yes.
* Security Reviews
* We should complete N security reviews before flipping the bit to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù. Who can commit to doing at least one security review in the next M weeks?
* David A. Wheeler: I‚Äôll add some, based on existing reviews (& link off to them)
* Submit PRs at [ossf/Project-Security-Reviews: A community collection of security reviews of open source software components. (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Reviews)
* Need a CC-BY attribution reference in LICENSE & in individual
* Maybe have a lawyer review this idea?
* Reviews are always point in time, need to include the date of the review (reviews age out of utility)
* Might be good to say whether or not ‚Äúthere are tools in the CI process‚Äù & how strong they are
* Once public, we expect that anyone can submit a pull request, there‚Äôd then be an approval flow - at least someone reviews (maybe 2)?
* Proposal: integrate package-feeds or some analysis of it <[https://github.com/ossf/package-feeds](https://github.com/ossf/package-feeds)>
* Tries to identify potentially (amateur) malicious packages
* Security Metrics
* Instructions now available, code updated on repo.
* Please file issues where things are broken
* Maybe we should convert name of Project-Security-Metrics to remove ‚ÄúProject‚Äù & switch to lowercase
* Set up security metrics website: perhaps metrics.openssf.org ?
* Consider renaming WG to ‚ÄòSecurity Metrics‚Äô? (Kay)
* current name is broad/vague
* can still be a home for security threats & weaknesses document
* just a thought‚Ä¶

Agenda



* David A. Wheeler posted on mailing list comments about metrics in current draft dashboard
* Dashboard README installation instructions are wrong (they‚Äôre for the old version); Michael will fix that later today so people can install it!
* [Ryan] Scorecard Access via GitHub UI
* Contact:Nicole Forsgren @ GitHub? -> Working on allowing researcher access to GitHub data.
* This shouldn‚Äôt block MVP and post-MVP development.
* Developer Lead needed
* Michael Scovetta: I have limited time, looking for someone to take over/help on metrics dashboard
* David A. Wheeler: I can help, but I also have limited time
* Kay: Reach out to Santiago - perhaps this is a project Purdue can help with?
* Kay: We can also propose this as a funding request to OpenSSF for hiring a contractor to work on it.
* Metrics Dashboard Architecture:
* Grafana -> UI
* Postgres -> DB
* Azure Function (C#) - uninteresting, just provides a web API to add/remove from Postgres.
* Scripts and stuff - Gather/parse/whatever data and send to the Azure Function. Mostly Python3.
  
* Discussion on [Security Reviews](https://github.com/scovetta/Project-Security-Reviews)
* This is NOT for vulnerability reports (CVEs)
* [Discuss/Finalize Template](https://github.com/scovetta/Project-Security-Reviews/wiki/Template/_edit)
* David A. Wheeler: Key issues: (1) Identify WHO did the review, (2) allow hypertext links to others‚Äô reviews (so we don‚Äôt have to host, which can be a copyright issue), (3) make it clear you might not agree, (4) lightweight process for adding/removing them (e.g., bogus & obsolete reviews), (5) clearly id what was reviewed
* Move this to OpenSSF (instead of Michael‚Äôs personal section)
* LF has paid for some reviews, could add those. LFPH, Linux kernel (OSTIF)
* Core team for Security Metrics Dashboard
* Pragash: how do we not bias projects based on the security reviews / metadata we provide
* Discourage small contributors from creating projects or appear to be endorsing projects created by large organizations
* Michael: Transparency - allow maintainers refute reviews, etc.
* Rather than beating people with one type of stick, have common criteria, e.g. assurance level
* Reference: [Evaluation Assurance Level - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_Assurance_Level) (note this is not for software)
* ‚ÄúEAL0‚Äù => Lowest level, default
* ‚ÄúEAL1+‚Äù => Have formal criteria for what constitutes a review.
* Add your ideas to the agenda

* Open Questions / Tasks:
* Can we launch Jan 15th so it can be part of the January press release?
* Is this too aggressive? What‚Äôs our next window after January?
* Owner:
* **Domain Name: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">metrics.</span>openssf.org?**
* Landing Page -> What it is, coming soon, etc.
* Owner:
  
* Ownership: Need infrastructure owned/managed by LF. (Can wait till post-launch.)
* Owner:
* I think we need a strategy for GitHub token limits.
* Idea: Website has user login, use *their* token when we run the analysis to collect the data. Then record that collected data and the date of the data collection. Others can then see that collected data, but they also see the date of the analysis (which may be quite old)... if they want it updated, they need to log in & use their token.
* BigQuery does allow queries on GitHub data. 
* There‚Äôs also ‚ÄúGitHub Torrent‚Äù but we think that‚Äôs basically dead
* Add In-toto export / API / etc.
* Need some docs, etc. written.

* Owner: 
* Need to add support for more forges, e.g., GitLab, independent git repos, etc.
* Anything else essential to do before launch?
 
* Security Reviews
* [Rationale](https://github.com/scovetta/Project-Security-Reviews)
* **reviews.openssf.org?**
* Microsoft can seed this resource with at least 100 reviews at launch -- but which other organizations can commit to contributing reviews?
* David Wheeler: I like making it easy to get security reviews. If there are multiple reviews, it‚Äôd be good to be able to show that. Also, make it possible to simply add URL(s) to existing security reviews (e.g., Linux kernel has several).
* How do we make sure attackers don‚Äôt exploit this.
* How do we verify/validate the authenticity of the reviewer?

* Kay Williams, Microsoft
* Dan Lorenc, Google
* David A. Wheeler, Linux Foundation
* Claudio Caracciolo, ElevenPaths (Telef√≥nica)
* Luigi Gubello, Arduino

Agenda



* Resetting on Architecture
* Idea: Instead of building a full system, let‚Äôs do something more streamlined -- create an API spec for getting data into and out of the system -- and use something like Grafana as a user interface for building and viewing dashboards. Target a few existing data sources (CII best practices, Scorecard, etc.) to get started.
* Concerns: prefer the dashboarding system to be open source makes it easier to integrate with anyway, find someplace for it to run so people don‚Äôt have to install anything.
* David: Maybe ‚Äúmetrics.openssf.org‚Äù - go there, paste in a URL of a project, and you learn things about the project?
* Use Open Hub as an inspiration, e.g., [https://www.openhub.net/p/openssl](https://www.openhub.net/p/openssl). They have an API Use Agreement - [https://community.synopsys.com/s/article/Black-Duck-Open-Hub-API-Use-Agreement](https://community.synopsys.com/s/article/Black-Duck-Open-Hub-API-Use-Agreement)   we don‚Äôt need  to USE OpenHub, just have it as an inspiration
* David: I think Mike S. was going to investigate dashboard options.
* Next Step: investigate dashboard options (Mike?)
* Name for ‚ÄòSecurity Metrics‚Äô project
* OSSUM (pronounced awesome) - ossum.org
* Fun name
* Difficult for non-native speakers - need to figure how something is pronounced before it makes sense.
* metrics.openssf.org
* Pros: close tie to openssf.org
* Cons: descriptive rather than ‚Äòfun‚Äô name (maybe this is a con?)
* We can always use both (multiple) and have one point to the other
* Other ideas?
* Review ‚ÄúCommon Goals, Scenarios and Requirements‚Äù
* Discuss ‚Äú[North Star - Security Metadata Store](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qoCnDW6eo17pZv09P114D07YpgFD45AEB0lgY8ixOyY/edit#heading=h.vathjepaqyt6)‚Äù
* Dashboard Options -
* We will document some information on dashboard options here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8w7Zf_v3hqfg7WpvvZ2RsoVU0FNzsjWJKFnrS-jsBs/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8w7Zf_v3hqfg7WpvvZ2RsoVU0FNzsjWJKFnrS-jsBs/edit#)
* David Wheeler will add some information to the ‚ÄúDashboard options‚Äù page to get us started.
* Threats, Risks, Mitigations Doc
* Do we want to plan for additional work here?
* Next meeting: The next meeting is scheduled for Dec 23, but that is very close to Christmas & many people may be unavailable. We‚Äôll wait for the lead to decide, but that particular meeting may get cancelled simply because too many people won‚Äôt be able to attend. If so, Happy New Year & see you in 2021.

* We saw a great deal of overlap and shared goals in this discussion, which helps us mitigate duplication of effort 
* **Action Items**: Prior to next meeting, start identifying overlapping goals and requirements (as well as where there are differences) - this can be done right in the doc  
* Threats, Risks, and Mitigations - Markdown conversation ([#16](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/pull/16))
* Do we want to collect ideas for a vNext release?
* We discussed accessibility of the document. This originated by Dan‚Äôs recommendation to convert this to markdown to make it easier for people to offer changes to the document which can more easily be merged. 
* Open question: Can screenreaders consume the document in its‚Äô current formats? 
* PDF or HTML can be consumed by screenreaders
* PDF is harder to iterate on than .md
* Markdown can render the HTML which can be consumed by screenreaders 
* We may wish to include alt text for the images so that screenreaders can consume it
* There are diagrams that are difficult to articulate as alt-text
* Open question: will we maintain the OSS Threats whitepaper? 
* **Action Items**: We can insert higher quality images into the document (Luigi) and work on alt text (TBD). 
* Security Metrics Update (Michael Scovetta)
* Project has been dockerized. Just clone the [repo](https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Metrics), update a few config files described [here](https://github.com/ossf/Project-Security-Metrics#developement), and run start.ps1.
* Next steps:
* Complete the new UX.
* Complete the first set of metrics (which are‚Ä¶?)
* **Action Items**: 
* All: Try out the project as noted above by Michael! 
* Ryan: Continued UX 
* Ryan/Michael/All: Converge on list of metrics for MVP 
* Jennifer: Documentation of metrics (explainer) for MVP

Metrics Update & Discussion
<ul>

<li><strong>UX Update: </strong>(Ryan)

<p>
Need a breakdown of per-version vs. per-project details. Dojo vs Dojo v.1.2.3 -- which metrics apply to the version and which to the project? 
<p>
Prioritize drilling in on a specific projects vs. making an ‚Äúalternativeto.net‚Äù for open source projects (at least initially).
<p>
How will user input be added to the platform (crowdsourced, etc.)?
<p>
<strong>Action: </strong>Need a breakdown of which metrics per tab, layout, etc.
<ul>

<li><strong>Initial Metrics:</strong> 
<ul>

<li>CII Badge Program

<li>Active Maintainers (from GitHub)

<li>Typo-Squatting Candidates (from Web Service)

<td>CII Best Practices Badge overview (David A. Wheeler)
<ul>

<li><strong>Action</strong>: In next week (TAC update), Mike to sync w/ Best Practices WG lead (+ David) to discuss where the CII BP Badge project should live from a WG perspective. Perhaps have Doodle poll on where CII Best Practices Badge should go in OpenSSF (Security Threats/Metrics or Best Practices/Education?)? Michael will set up meeting to begin that discussion

<li><strong>Operational overhead:</strong> Currently very low human overhead, LF pays for infrastructure (small).

<li><strong>Presentation</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/cii-bp-badge-intro.pptx">https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/cii-bp-badge-intro.pptx</a>

<li>Kamaleshwar said he‚Äôd had some kind of problem getting a CII badge. Immediately after the meeting he tried again with another repo, and the CII Best Practices badge application had no issues & automatically filled in 14% of the answers. We‚Äôre not sure what happened earlier, but the concern appears to have been a false alarm. If there are problems in the future, please contact David A. Wheeler dwheeler@linuxfoundation.org.

<p>

Recap: What‚Äôs already been done?



* CHAOSS [https://chaoss.community/](https://chaoss.community/) - identified a huge number of different possible metrics.
* CII / Best Practices Badge Program - [https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org)
* NIST ‚ÄúCode Complexity‚Äù [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8165.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8165.pdf)
* ‚ÄúOSSC Dashboard - Potential Metrics‚Äù (some proposed metrics definitions): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/119YwYxf5Fy09CjPX6h-yuKZOY4XjCCuDSD_Ryj14s64/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/119YwYxf5Fy09CjPX6h-yuKZOY4XjCCuDSD_Ryj14s64/edit#gid=0)
* ‚ÄúOSSC Project Metrics‚Äù (‚Äòspec‚Äô start, summarizes how it might be used) [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxfJELTALybwYy8TLmCM1S5VK2GrDU_KIJpg8ZmHFJk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxfJELTALybwYy8TLmCM1S5VK2GrDU_KIJpg8ZmHFJk/edit)
* (OSSC) ‚ÄúDashboard UX Mockup‚Äù - a mock up: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKQejvVwADeKwi8Z_1XkhRA1yeXtG-BS/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKQejvVwADeKwi8Z_1XkhRA1yeXtG-BS/view?usp=sharing)

Idea: Create a ‚ÄúPer-project dashboard‚Äù. Who are contributors, what tooling, etc.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place to understand a project comprehensively‚Äù - bring all the metrics into one place (contributors over time, CII Best Practices, etc.) so you can see it all in one place. Not necessarily a ‚Äúrisk score‚Äù for a project, but could. Focus on being transparent - shows ‚Äúthe facts‚Äù underlying this. Want to go broad.

The goal is to do this for 50K+ projects, not 50 - basically want to support a large number.

Once those are displayed, others can take action. E.g., if a project is critical, spend resources to address it.

Possible rename: Change ‚ÄúIdentifying‚Äù to ‚ÄúSurfacing‚Äù.

Current proposals from OSSC: \


One challenge: Naming packages. (CII Census II specifically noted package naming as a problem!)

PackageURL -> ‚Äúpurl‚Äù [https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)

Another alternative is using URL of repository and/or home page.

Wheeler: I‚Äôve proposed adding repo URL & home page URL to packageURL, then purl could cover those too.

Wheeler: I‚Äôd be happy to tweak the CII Best Practices badge API so that you can send it a URL & it replies with badge level, it‚Äôs close to that anyway & that would simplify its integration into larger dashboards. GitHub issue: [https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1460](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1460) (this has since been completed)

ClearlyDefined -> [https://clearlydefined.io/](https://clearlydefined.io/) - focused on licenses, but has had to deal with package naming problem

Libraries.io -> [https://libraries.io/](https://libraries.io/) Focus on dependencies

[https://search.gocenter.io/k8s.io/kubernetes?version=v1.15.0-alpha.0.0.20191104222411-ac756284b890&tab=readme](https://search.gocenter.io/k8s.io/kubernetes?version=v1.15.0-alpha.0.0.20191104222411-ac756284b890&tab=readme)

‚ÄúGo Center‚Äù - [https://search.gocenter.io/](https://search.gocenter.io/) - combines many metrics, but only for Go.

Include badges from project‚Äôs readme files in the dashboard.

Intend to have a draft dashboard implemented by end of October (somewhat aggressive).

Instead of ‚Äúboiling the ocean‚Äù, let‚Äôs build a small draft with just a few metrics. CII is easy, we can include that. Add a few more.

Then‚Ä¶ how do we compute a (combined) score?

Wheeler: I suggest gathering the data first, then later working out a ‚Äúscore‚Äù (if you can!) once patterns are more likely.

In the long term, support research/experiments. E.g., Graph of dependency, can determine ‚Äúvulnerable dependency doesn‚Äôt really matter in this case‚Äù.

Change the WG title to match what we‚Äôre actually doing (project dashboard).
