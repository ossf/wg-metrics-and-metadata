:calendar: One day event : January 25th 2023 – 10:30 EST

### What?

Virtual meeting for critical maintainers of open source software.

Provide a space where maintainers of said projects can share their problems, pain points,  and common experiences around the challenges of securing and maintaining their projects.

### What is not?

This is not an effort to drive OSS community to achieve higher security level by presenting solutions, but to explore in detail the particular pain points experienced by open source projects- not to be confused with Alpha-Omega project
( It is rather a public forum/space to let people know about their efforts to make their OSS project more secure )
